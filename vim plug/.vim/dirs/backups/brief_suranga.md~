## OPEN WRITING INITIATIVE (OWI): BRIEF 

**INTRO**

The Open Writing Initiative (OWI) will be an open source culture project designed to spread the joy of creative writing to all. Through exercises, drills, and collective (and open) writing, the OWI will help writers - young, old, new and experienced - to get their creative juices flowing. 

The initiative is being led by Miragian Studios, but is open for contributions from writers of all backgrounds. 


**WHY**

On one hand, writing instructions online are either [expensive](link to Masterclass goes here), [theoretical](link to online writing classes), or [center their offering around writing and selling 100s of books a year on Amazon](Kindle writing advice). 

On the other, the publishing industry hasn't still come to terms with ['what do with the internet'](link to publishing industry column decrying the Amazon v Traditional Publishing dynamic, as well as the fight against fan fiction). 

The OWI hopes to address both of these issues.


**HOW**

Our focus is on process and practical. Our ethos is very much inspired by the Open Source Software (OSS) and DYI self-learning that underpins - or will underpin - much of how we choose to learn and share knowledge in the future. We believe open knowledge sharing and collaboration is the future. 

Our content - mostly video based at the start - will be open and shared on [GitHub], the world's largest repository for open software. This means that all written content presented in the videos on [Miragian Studios' YouTube channel] will be available for anyone, from anywhere to use, modify, and adapt as they wish. This process is central to the workings of the open source software eco-system - likewise, this process of opening and sharing of the manuscripts for writers to use and modify as they wish will be central to OWI. 

To achieve this, OWI will have the following channels:

- OWI Website hosted on [Miragian Studios' website](https://miragian.com)
- OWI content on Miragian Studios' YouTube 
- OWI Open Stories on GitHub 
- TikTok 
- Twitch 
- Facebook 


**REQUIREMENTS**

A modern logo that captures the joy of writing and the spirit of open source. Since this is a digital first brand, I would like to take inspiration from the following sources: 

1. Project Odin
2. GitHub 
3. Mastadon
4. Habitica 

Note how all these logos have common design elements

- They are all digital first 
- They can be reduced to one symbol logos like app icons 
- There is a mix of typography and visual element in the logo 


The logo would need to suit the above requirements. 

I would like the emphasis on typography to be around clean, extremely pleasant to read font. I would also like the symbol in the logo to be around a hand typing on a keyboard.
