## INTRODUCTION

This course is designed to offer an end to end “toolkit” for both entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs from the very start of their project until it reaches “maturity” i.e. a company or an intrapreneurial project generating a recurring level of sales and beginning its international development.

The course follows a chronological order, and offers answers based on real life experiences of crucial questions for potential entrepreneurs or intrapreneurs:
- Is my personality fit to this particular type of professional endeavour? 
- What tools can I use to generate an idea that is actually disrupting? 
- What is the best strategy I can use to gather a founding team? 
- What tools can I leverage to generate a disrupting idea? 
- Should I really raise money, and if so, what are the negotiations pitfalls I should expect with investors and what tools can I use to monitor my cash burn? 
- How do I launch my product, from a very practical standpoint, and with limited budget: how do I generate the “client impact” and master the art of selling my product to someone I meet for the first time? 
- How do I recruit the first employees or contributors to my project, taking into account that nobody knows my company? 
- How do I initiate my international development with limited budget? 
- Last, what should be my exit strategy considering that I should never sell my company, but instead generate the right set of conditions so that rich players want to buy me at some point? 

## Description

This course covers in chronological order each defining step of an entrepreneurial project. It begins with very personal considerations related to getting to  know yourself better so as to decide if you are ready for the multiple challenges of entrepreneurship. It then deals with creativity in order to provide the right set of tools to find an idea with the right potential to disrupt an existing business. We then discuss how to gather a founding team, how to raise money to initiate the project, and how to deal with day to day cash management. Later in the course, we discuss the art of selling, focusing on business to business sales, and how to measure the product launch phase using cohort analysis. Later on, we discuss the challenges of HR in an entrepreneurial environment, and of recruiting at a point where nobody knows your company. We then describe very practical techniques to initiate the international development of a small company. Last, we cover the exit strategy topic.

### Introduction to Entrepreneurship Strategy: From Ideation to Strategy

- This course will give you a toolkit, end-to-end, from the start of your project to its maturity 
- The main goal is the new venture will generate sales and embark on international development 
- This course can be applied to both entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs 
- The course will be chronological order, asking and answering crucial questions
- The main question to ask before we begin an entrepreneurial journey are:
    - Is my personality fit for this journey? 
    - What tools exist to generate ideas?
    - What is the strategy to form a founding team? 
    - Should I raise money? 
        - What are the pitfalls of raising external capital? 
        - Tools to monitor cash burn?
    - How do I launch the project? 
    - How do I recruit the first employees, taking into account the fact that no one knows my project or me? 
    - How do I expand internationally? 
    - What should my exit strategy be?
- The course will examine four main parts, starting with the most important aspect of an entrepreneurial journey: you 
- In this first week, we will examine *intrinsic values* within you, and assess if these innate values can help you along your entrepreneurial journey 
    - We will also see how you can analyze and then consolidate your belief system - the set of values that are the pillars of your personal and professional life
- In the second week, we will see how to secure the first steps of your entrepreneurial journey
    - We will examine creativity and tools to unlock the creative problem solver within you. **PLEASE NOTE** This isn't about coming up with the next big unicorn startup; rather, it is about finding ideas that have a real competitive advantage 
    - We also examine questions surrounding picking the Founding Team 
    - We will look deeply at questions of funding the venture 
- In the third week, we will discover how to ignite the project 
    - In this module, we will discuss day-to-day cash management - you will discover traditional tools of financial management have little relevance here 
    - One of the most important, and under-rated parts of entrepreneurship is Sales Management, and the fine art of managing sales meetings 
    - Finally in week 3, we will look means of measuring the launch of a new project using techniques such as cohort analysis, which puts you in a position to get the right signal of *when* to launch your project, and course-correct from potential mistakes as early as possible 
- In the fourth and final week, we will look at the *path to maturity*, where we deal with the final steps necessary steps to bring your project into maturity 
    - In this section we will deal with issues such as Human Resource Management; recruiting when no one knows who you are, managing first employees when the scale of the company is changing every week, are tough challenges that can test even veteran entrepreneurs 
    - Finally in week 4, we will consider the factors to take into account when its time to exit; indeed, it is best to start with the end goal in mind as it will impact some of the key choices you will have to make, so that you can get bought out as opposed to selling the company 


#### Lesson 1: Identifying Your Personal Values 

**Personal Values Part 1** 

- What is the first thing that comes to mind when the word entrepreneurship is mentioned?
- Most entrepreneurs would say that entrepreneurship is that a long and uncertain journey 
- Perception of the realities of entrepreneurship are far different from the media stories of highly successful people 
- Most of these media public relations exercises that aim to make the journey sound far easier and less stressful than it really is 
- Whether we like it or not, these stories are in our minds - consciously or otherwise 
- Reality rarely follows the blue-sky patterns that are typical of the Silicon Valley unicorns 
- Speaking to the vast majority of entrepreneurs will show you how typical uncertainty, unexpected challenges, and patience are Reality rarely follows the blue-sky patterns that are typical of the Silicon Valley unicorns 
- Speaking to the vast majority of entrepreneurs will show you how typical uncertainty, unexpected challenges, and patience are 
Reality rarely follows the blue-sky patterns that are typical of the Silicon Valley unicorns 
Speaking to the vast majority of entrepreneurs will show you how typical uncertainty, unexpected challenges, and patience are 

**Personal Values Part 2** 

- Due to the uncertainty that is inherent in entrepreneurship, it is vital that we get to know ourselves before the start of our entrepreneurial journey 
- There are two pillars that you can count on
    - Values 
    - Intrinsic Programs 
- The above two can be formulated in positive or negative ways. For instance, 'freedom is more important to me than anything else' is a value turned into a positive way; on the contrary, 'I never want to work for someone else' is basically the same value but turned into a negative value 
- It is important to understand where our personal value system originates from 
- Values are subjective - mine would be different to yours 
- Values change as we change, and as the world around us change 
- Values can be three different categories 
    - Inherited values: these are values that have been consciously or otherwise transmitted to you by your parents, schooling system and peers 
    - Compulsory values: these are values that have developed as an opposition to situations that you have faced during your childhood 
    - Self-generated values: these are values that have been generated as a result of life experience, usually much later in life. 
- A good question to ponder at this point is: **What are my top five personal values?** 
- Note what these values are, and what *kind of value* they are: i.e. are they inherited, compulsory, or self-generated? 
- Being introspective at this point on questions such as this will give you clarity - as sometimes, clarity is difficult to obtain when in the midst of a project 

**ASSIGNMENT** 
- List down your top five personal values, and what kind of value they are



#### Lesson 2: Your Intrinsic Values and Cashflow Quadrant 

**Identifying the intimate pillars of your entrepreneurial journey: Personal Values Part 1** 

- In this section we will learn more about **intrinsic programs** 
- Think of these as the lines of code that define the person that you are 
- There are many intrinsic programs but a few of them are
    - **Towards** vs **Away** programs 
        - Towards person is one who is motivated by reaching a goal whereas an Away person is someone who will do everything to avoid a situation. For example: a towards person is someone who might phrase the decision to be an entrepreneur as 'I want to be free and make my own decisions', while an Away person would phrase the same scenario as 'I never want to have a boss that tells me what to do'
        - Where do you find yourself in this spectrum? 
        - It is perfectly fine no matter where in the spectrum you fall 
        - How, then, do you identify between these two intrinsic programs in yourself and people? 
        - It is important to pay attention to speech patterns. Towards Persons will use phrasing such as 'Our aim', or 'the goals that we are aspiring to are' while Away Persons will use phrasing such as 'What we want to avoid' or 'We want to make sure that we don't' 
        - Seeing this distinction will allow entrepreneurs to change their language accordingly to the person they are talking to: for example, if in the course of your entrepreneurial journey you, you come across an Away Person at a sales meeting, then it's important to emphasize security and reliability of the product or service that you are selling 
    - **Options** vs **Procedures** person 
        - In this spectrum, an Options Person is someone who would like to their options open while a Procedures Person would be someone who would want a pre-defined set of options from the beginning
        - When making a commercial proposal to an Options Person it is best to have a wide variety of options, modules and sub-modules for this person to choose form while, in the case of an Away Person, you should limit the options to two or three possibilities 
    - **In Time** vs **Through Time** persons
        - **In Time** Persons would be fully engaged throughout a discussion but forget what was said before and what lies after - think about people who finish meetings later than scheduled 
        - **Through Time** Persons would have a good memory of the before and after of the meeting but may not be fully engaged in the present moment 
        - During sales meetings with one of the above, it is possible to use this knowledge to customize your meeting schedules, speed and tempo of your meetings based on where the person falls in the spectrum 
    - **Global** vs **Detailed** 
        - Detail People look for small details, and need each detailed perfectly explained before moving on 
        - Global People are big picture people 
        - Think of these two kinds of people as forest vs trees 
        - In projects, it is essential to have a good mix between Global and Detailed persons, in order to ensure that neither the big picture is forgotten nor the small details, possibly critical details, are forgotten 
    - **Thinking** vs **Feeling** 
        - Feeling people tend to react based on their initial reactions or feelings 
        - Thinking people can overly rationalize
- The important lesson to understand between the intrinsic programs discussed above is that there is no correct way to follow through; what is critical is having the right balance between these archetypes so that a project or a new venture can benefit from the advantages each intrinsic program begins to the overall direction and execution of an initiative 

**ASSIGNMENT** 
- Think about where you fall in the various spectra of the five archetypes. 
- Are you **Towards** or **Away From** person? 
- Are you an **Options** or **Procedures** person? 
- Are you **In Time** or **Through Time** person? 
- Are you **Global** or Detailed** person? 
- Are you **Thinking** or **Feeling** person? 
- Remember there is no right answer, no right way 
- It is also important to remember that humans aren't binary by nature - most of us fall into the spectrum in the above archetypes
- Of vital importance is to remember that all these programs have innate value and bring unique advantages and perspectives that are necessary for the proper functioning of a team, project or any collective endeavour 



**Choosing Entrepreneurship compared to other options: The Cash Flow Quadrant**

- Now that we've got to know ourselves through two different lenses, it is important to consider the entrepreneurship in the context of choices - in economics, this is opportunity cost 
- What different options do you have for your professional life? Where does entrepreneurship fall in context to these options, and your life? 
- A good tool to use here is the simplified version of Robert Kyosaki's **Cash Flow Quadrant** 

![image-20210730144458521](image-20210730144458521.png)

- **EMPLOYEE**
    - The certainty and stability of a monthly pay slip 
    - An organization *lends* you the job
    - You can be replaced 
    - Accountability to others 
    - Compensation based on the position assigned
- **SELF EMPLOYED** 
    - You own the job 
    - Accountability is to yourself 
    - No lack of certainty and stability 
    - No predefined compensation 
- **BUSINESS OWNERS** 
    - You own the system 
    - People work for you 
    - Money works for you 
    - Stability and certainty aren't present 
    - Ability to create systems that are self-sustaining 
- **INVESTOR** 
    - Money works for you 
    - You are accountable to your finances 

**The Life Choices of Entrepreneurship: Identifying Trade-offs** 

- While the Cash Flow Quadrant is a good tool to help you visualize and introspect on the opportunity costs that are inherent in choosing an entrepreneurial journey, such choices can't be left merely to intellectualization 
- This is a life choice and thus comes up with a pros and cons that you have to account for when choosing the entrepreneur life
- Let us consider the following
    - **Freedom of time management** 
        - Flexible times 
        - Low collaboration and loneliness if you are embarking on your own sans a founding team 
        - High disagreements and passionate discussions coming from the relatively more democratic decision-making processes in a startup 
        - Consider the following question: *When do you think projects are most intense?** 
            - When you are preparing your venture and defining business model and founding team 
            - At the beginning, once you've launched 
            - Gradually, after launching
    - **Passion projects take a lot of discipline to disassociate your emotional investment with cold reality of the marketplace** 
        - It is natural to be challenged, advice, opinion
    - **Hard to compartmentalize between home and work life** 
        - This is especially true if your venture begins with you working from home
    - **Freedom**
        - This freedom of being accountable to yourself comes with trade-offs such as instability of monthly income 
- As you probably know by now, entrepreneurship is filled with trade-offs and sacrifices; in order to enjoy some aspects of life, you must renounce others 
- Stop for a moment now to think of the following: 
    - Top 5 things you would value in your entrepreneur lifestyle 
    - Top 5 things that would be most challenging for you
- Considering these aspects of entrepreneur lifestyle will help you make smarter choices when faced with trade-offs 
- Knowing your intrinsic programs would help you understand and overcome the challenges that are inherent in entrepreneurship 
- For instance, if you are an **Away** person who is driven by the absolute willingness to avoid taking orders, then constantly reminding yourself about this will serve as a constant source of motivation and personal drive, even at the hardest points in the journey 
- Getting to know yourself to this degree will also help you accept some of the trade-offs of entrepreneurship such as the opportunity cost of losing financial security and stable monthly income 


**Understanding Your Belief System** 

- Once you have thought deeply on getting to know yourself - through *Values*, *Intrinsic Programs*, and *Cash Flow Quadrant* - we move to learning more about the unique belief systems we all have 
- In this lesson, we are going to identify your beliefs, analyze them, and consolidate them as you grow during your entrepreneurial journey 
- Strong, resilient belief systems are crucial in your entrepreneurial journey; beliefs are a constantly evolving phenomenon within you that are based on your life experiences, and your interpretation of those events with the benefit of hindsight 
- Beliefs aren't binary true or false, instead they are aspects you choose to believe in 
- Beliefs can empower you or they can limit you. For example: 'I always find a solution to complex problems' and 'I am not good with numbers' are two beliefs that fall on empowering and limiting your decision making
- Before we dive into this, let's consider the following question: **Why do you think it's important to recognize your beliefs and how they impact your behaviour?**
    - Improve team interactions 
    - Avoid difficult situations 
    - Time management 
    - Better decision-making
- Knowing what empowers you, and what disempowers you helps you make better decisions 
- Prior to beginning your entrepreneurial journey, take stock of what your beliefs are
- Then identify if these are *empowering* or *disempowering/limiting* beliefs 
- Adopt new beliefs
- Identifying, analyzing and consolidating beliefs is a process that will take time but starting that process at this point will lead to clear-headedness when it comes to decision-making 


**ASSIGNMENT** 
- Identify your 5 empowering beliefs 
- Identify your 5 disempowering/limiting beliefs 
- Identify 2-3 new beliefs that you think you need to incorporate and consolidate into your belief system 


**Strengthening Your Beliefs**

- Adopting new beliefs entails telling yourself *little lies* 
- Let us consider the questions: **What little lies do you need to tell yourself to strengthen your belief system with new empowering beliefs?** 
    - Accounting 
    - Sales 
    - Management 
    - Innovation 
- It is in management that these little lies can be valuable 
- This can be termed *Belief-Based Management*
- One such lie that you can tell yourself is that *chance and luck doesn't exist*
- Of course we know that chance and luck are very much part of the equation of most parts of life, and indeed entrepreneurial ventures 
- But convincing yourself that luck and chance are a result of something you did well or not well enough 
- Let's now move to the notion of *failure* 
- You can convince yourself that failure doesn't exist - only feedback 
- These are two examples of empowering beliefs that you can incorporate into your toolbox 
- When it comes to *feasibility*, you can convince yourself that if someone else has done something similar, that there is no reason why you or your venture can't do the same thing 
- What about emotions? Most behaviour that manifests in organizations because of positive intention. Instead of feeling threatened or aggravated, it is possible to ask yourself what the intention behind the behaviour is. 
    - For instance: What is the best way to increase productivity? 
        - Flexible hours 
        - Diffusing passion 
        - Reorganizing teams 
    - Of course the best way to increase productivity is to give your team something that they are passionate about to work on. This can come under the notion that work is best when work is akin to play 
- Another little lie that you can tell yourself is *It isn't necessary to understand everything in order to able to use everything*; this is especially useful mental trick that you can tell yourself when you have to utilize skills that aren't your strong suit 
- Finally: *If you always do what you've always done, the you'll always get what you always got*; this is a good mental trick to convince yourself (and your team) to always remain in a constant state of re-engineering 
- Other little mental tricks and little lies to tell yourself: *Quality of communication is in the response that you get* - this means that if someone doesn't understand you, then it's probably because you've not done a great job in communicating it



#### WEEK 1 ASSIGNMENT 

- Develop a commercial proposition for a product or service of your choice and try to sell it to two different people positioned on the extreme edges of a particular intrinsic program spectrum.

- You will choose one intrinsic program from among the ones presented in the course (towards/away from, options/procedures, in time/through time, detail/global, feeling/thinking).

- The product or service can  be a product that you are going to create for your own company in the future, or a product produced by your current company
