# THE SPACES THAT MADE US  

*In the same tongue our phrases wear masks*,
*Where light and shadow speak several dialects,*
*Where your night is half a day behind me,*
*Where you shiver at the same hour when I sweat*
*Where your world is tilted one way, and mine another.*

*In the same tongue our phrases span many maps,*
*Where the cartography of boundaries is our fate,*
*Where the rivers that bound us are now damned,*
*Where my sky is a different shade of blue to yours,*
*Where the wind blows you one way, and me another.*

*In the same tongue our phrases span many histories,*
*Where time and space can no longer make us relate,*
*Where the present and past are hostage to bloodlines,*
*Where the future sums all out joys and miseries,*
*Where we divide this nostalgia in half:*

*A piece of me for you, a piece of you for me.*

'Do you want to get married?'

The question was over WhatsApp on a January morning. 

I was on my commute to work through Colombo's morning traffic; she was in, in her parents' home in Philadelphia. I said 'yes' with little hesitation. Five minutes later, we decided to get married. Then she went to bed while I went about my day at the advertising agency. 

'Decided' is such a strange choice of words to associate with marriage. The global wedding industrial complex, and recently social media, has convinced and compelled us - yes, even us millennials who are increasingly finding the idea of marriage and grand weddings, even monogamy, silly - that marriages have to be marked with ostentatious celebrations in real life, and that the carefully coordinated and choreographed imagery arising from the grand revelry be shared on our social feeds. 


If a wedding happened in front of no one, did it happen at all?

It was the dawn of 2020. Remember what that was like? 

Most of the world hadn't started using this new parlance that we use today as if they were always part of us. Words like 'pandemic', 'zoonotic', 'novel virus', 'corona', 'covid', ‘variant’, ‘herd immunity’. 

Most of us outside Wuhan viewed the events happening in the city the way we view conflict and war: news cycles, social media and cable news have all but confined us to a spectrum between dispassionate apathy and helpless empathy, between empty rage and morbid curiosity.

And so it was when she and I *decided* to get married, Covid-19 was just that: another news cycle.

We'd met three years prior on Tinder, neither of us looking for commitment, both of us using Tinder for the informal, the temporary, the hurried, and the solely physical that the dating app had morphed into. I had just seen my debut novel win a local literary prize, she - an anthropologist and film-maker by training, with Sri Lankan roots - had arrived in the island to start work on a non-profit. 

Sri Lanka is a small island, and Colombo, the capital city, is a tiny city of just over a million residents. Colombo-ites joke among ourselves that most of us middle-class people would know someone, know *of* someone, or know someone who knows someone that would know a Colombo person being talked about. 

If you visit and stay in the city long enough, chances are you will have many overlapping circles of Colombo friends. Somehow, despite all this, we spent those first three months of 2017 unaware of each other. This changed when she visited a bookshop, and saw *First Utterance* on display on the shelves. Two weeks later, she'd tell me that she picked the book because of the cover, and swiped right on Tinder because my profile picture was the same cover. She had yet to read the book when finally our paths crossed.

We'd been living in different parts of the world for three months when we decided to get married. 

In September 2019, she - and our dog Allison - left to the States after her visa expired. Couples talk of how challenging long distance relationships can be, and most of it is inevitable. But we'd done the work needed to ensure that this inevitability could be managed until I could join her in the States. We did this through consistent, long and difficult discussions, aided by a couple's therapist. 

The idea that a unmarried couple would even need therapy is fairly novel. In Sri Lanka, where bad marriages survive 'for the sake of the children', because 'my grandparents didn't need these things, my parents didn't - and they were married for decades! This just another bullshit service Westerners came up with to make money!', it is positively alien. 

But I had a good reason to seek help: I was cheating on her well into the relationship. 

When I finally confessed, I did so with a promise that I would seek help. Over the next few months, as her visa expiry date drew closer and closer, I found myself digging into the deepest parts of my psyche, wondering why my prediliction for self-sabotage of relationships (being emotionally unavailable was my modus operandi with previous partners) had morphed into infidelity. The more I went to these sessions, the clearer I seemed to think. Seeing my progress, she agreed to couple's therapy around June 2019. We had perhaps three months to work on ourselves, each other, and what the future entailed for us. 

I committed to stay faithful; even the prospect of long distance with a partner in a different hemisphere, in a different timezone, no longer frightened me. The prospect of losing her for good was far, far scarier.

September came. 

On the day she left, it rained so hard that several parts of the city was flooded for days after. The weather chose a difficult day for this act of symbolism. 

But we navigated those first months apart well. 

We'd prepared. 

And when, on that day in January, she asked me if I wanted to get married, I knew I was on the path to regaining her trust in me. I'd earned it the hard way. I couldn't be happier when I said 'yes', but in my head, it was more 'fuck yes, I want to marry you'.

In Colombo, we'd spend days, sometimes an entire week, in the annex that she'd rented from her uncle. 

The location was unusual because it was right in front of Colombo's main prison. Colombo isn't a planned city: spend enough time here, and you'll see how eccentric or senseless some of it really is. This apartment stood opposite to the Welikada Prison on Baseline Road, one of Colombo's primary arteries. Flanked on either side is Wesley College, one of the oldest schools in the country, the school’s athletic park, and a Church. During the day, the sound of traffic was so loud that it was hard to think, but in each other's presence this seemed to matter little. Our conversations would start over a drink on her balcony as the sun descended and a gradual decrease in volume - not silence, never silence - would cocoon us. 

Our first year together was mostly spent in that balcony and in her bedroom but around June of 2018, now comfortably into our second year together, she wondered out aloud: 'Should I adopt a dog?'

My answer to that question is almost never going to be 'no'- I'd grown up dog-less despite wanting one all throughout my childhood. 

On a Saturday morning, we went to the adoption agency, looking for a 'black dog' (her words, not mine). Barely a minute passed, when she glanced upon a tiny puppy that sat quietly in the corner of the pen while the other pups desperately tried to gain the attention of the people passing by. This pup was white, with a heart-shaped nose, and black pearl-y eyes. It was love at first sight for both of them. 

Travelling back home, pup in my arms slobbering all over my shirt, she turned to me and said, 'I know what I am going to call her: Allison!'

'Why Allison?'

'Allison from *Northline*, my favourite novel.' 

Looking back now, that was the moment - in that tiny space afforded by Colombo's ubiquitous three-wheeler taxi, caught in traffic, horns blaring around us on that hot Saturday afternoon - when we stopped being mere lovers, and started being family.

The wedding was now fast approaching. 

Still in Philly, she asked me what kind of wedding I wanted. I wasn't religious but I always imagined a wedding at my favourite Hindu Temple, five minutes walk from my home in Colombo's Kotahena neighbourhood. 

Over 150 years old and made of pure granite, its architectural beauty, and its cave sanctum-like interiors, the *Sri Ponnambalavaneswara Devasthanam* was the only temple I liked being taken to as a child. Why? Because the temple used to have bats hanging on its high ceilings, the collective clicking of bats echoed around the halls of the temple. As an adult, even an outwardly atheist one, I found myself transported when entering this temple (now, sans bats on ceilings). Other Hindu temples garish, overly modern, polished and shiny, were positively cartoonish in comparison to this edifice. 

But Hindu temples only allow for traditional celebrations. I wanted alcohol, I wanted meat, I wanted a DJ playing metal music - I wanted a reception so I could celebrate with family and friends.  

The global industrial wedding complex got to me too, despite my antipathy. 

She told me that her dream wedding was the two of us eloping to Las Vegas, and getting married with an Elvis Presley impersonator as the officiant - only much later did I realize she wasn't joking. 

----

It was late 2018 when she decided she'd enough of living in front of a prison. 

Weeks went in house hunting before she stumbled upon a little house by in Colombo's Rajagiriya neighbourhood. The house was on an artificially created island, in the last lane, right in front of the lake, which was in itself home to a thriving eco-system of migratory birds, monitor lizards, and snakes. 

Our family had a home, albeit a temporary lasting the year leading up to her departure to the States in September 2019. It was home because it is only in a home that we can break and remould ourselves.  

It was here I would wake up ridiculously early so that I could learn to walk a dog for the first time. 

It was here that I started bird watching with binoculars. 

It was here in this former swamp that had been turned to a quiet residential neighbourhood, relatively untouched by light pollution, that I learnt to use a telescope for the first time. 

It was here where I confessed my infidelities.

It was also here that I promised to seek help.

It was here we'd come back from therapy, exhausted from the unburdening. 

In the midst of all the joys and tumult, it was also here I knew with certainty that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.

February 2020. 

The pressures of organizing a wedding from two different time zones, from two different cultural mindsets, had begun to take a toll. We sought more time with the therapist, she joining us virtually from her room in Philly.  

Meanwhile, the outside world was changing. Airports in some parts of the world were closing as the virus that had started within China was now spreading fast. The first pandemic in a century was upon us. 

But we were still unaware. 

Within the space of a few weeks, we'd gone from excitement, to sheer dread at the prospect of getting married. 

---
By late February 2020, airports across the world were shutting down. 

Covid-19 was now a fully blown pandemic in Europe, Middle East, and parts of South East Asia. She was in the midst of buying flight tickets to Sri Lanka, when she said: 'I think we should call off the wedding’; travelling with her elderly parents would be far too risky. I agreed. 

With little warning to our family and friends, most of whom were in the process of RSVPing to our invites, we announced the wedding would be indefinitely postponed due to Covid-19. 

---

It was now a week after we'd called off the wedding. 

Sri Lanka, and Sri Lankans were still relatively untouched by the pandemic, and many of my friends and family here wondered if had been too hasty in postponing. That all changed on the third week of March. Sri Lankan authorities announced the first case of Covid-19 among the local populace, and immediately announced the closure of airports in the country. 

Our decision to postpone the wedding had been vindicated, but by then we didn't care. 

Our relationship, our family, was on the verge of collapse.

April 25th 2020. 

A month or so from the date we'd have got married, we are once again in a virtual meeting room for a couple's therapy session. Three years prior, on this exact date, around the exact time, we were on our first date

People speak about how distant and cold working from home can be, how virtual meetings are somehow way more emotionally draining than meetings in person, but in matters of the heart, this cold distance meant nothing. On this night, she asked for a few minutes to speak to the therapist privately before she broke the news: 

'I think we are over, I don't think this can be fixed'. 

---

The poem that begins this piece was written a few days after. 

The space between us had yawned from nautical miles to emotional estrangement. The only bridge that remained was Allison. Even though we agreed to dial down communications, we also agreed that I would remain emotionally present and invested in Allison’s life. But no more were those videos and photos of Allison accompanied with any message meant for me. 

No emojis.

No in-jokes that we'd built around Allison's dramatic, woe-is-me, princess-like persona. 

My birthday came and went in May - a hollow birthday spent in my room, celebrating with family and friends over video calls. 

---

If a wedding happened in front of no one, did it happen at all? 

A month had passed since we decided to end the relationship, but slowly, imperceptibly we'd started going back on our agreement to decrease contact. Partly driven by Allison, partly driven by the clarity that comes from giving each other space, our conversations had regained the old effortlessness. Banter became jokes became flirting became calm conversations on what we'd learnt over the tumultuous first half of 2020 - about ourselves, each other, our same-but-different cultural mindsets, about our families at home, about *our family*. 

'Do you want to get married?'

This time the question was posed over a WhatsApp video call. Again, I had no hesitation. 

How does one get married when the world is in the midst of a pandemic, and the two of you are hemispheres apart?

July 13th, 2020. 

She is dressed in floral dress, in her room in Philly. It is around 11am for her. 

I am dressed in *sarong*, fabric wrapped around the waist, a favourite among Sri Lankan men because of our insufferable tropical heat, in my room. It is around 8.30pm for me. 

We are both dialled into our scheduled appointment, given by the Media County Marriages Licence-issuing authority. 

The two of us are early. 

I am shirtless, thinking I'd wear the shirt a minute before our appointment was due. 

She suggests that I wear the shit now, *just in case*. 

I put down my headphone and turn my back as I grab the shirt I'd placed on my bed. 

I wear it, humming a little tune, a little too loud for someone who can't sing. I realize that in my excitement I'd worn the shirt inside-out. *Silly bugger*, I laugh at myself, and take off the shirt, and wear it the right way this time. My back is turned to the laptop throughout all this. 

Unbeknownst to me, Mr E, the city official has joined the virtual room. My wife-to-be, tries desperately to get my attention, but the audio is coming out through the headphones, and I hear none of it. Resigned, she face-palms instead. Mr E also watches this farce play itself out, but (I was told later), watches in silence. 

When finally, I turn to face the laptop, I see her rolling her eyes, half laughing, half annoyed. A middle-aged Black man is eyeing me over the rim of his spectacles that have slid half way down his nose. 

I silently curse myself, but sit down with an embarrassed smile. 

'Before we being', Mr E finally spoke: 'Theena, how hot is it where you are, man?'

I do a quick mental calculation: 'Err, 87 degrees Fahrenheit', I reply.

'I'd be shirtless too.'

We laugh. 

'So you two want to get married?'j

'Yes', we say in unison. 

***END***
