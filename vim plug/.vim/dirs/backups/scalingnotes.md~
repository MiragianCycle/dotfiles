## WEEK 1: Introduction to Scaling 

**INTRODUCTION**

- Fredrick Taylor's 'The Principles of Scientific Management' revolutionized how management scholars viewed efficiency in the work place 
- These were the same ideas that fuelled the Model T Assembly in Henry Ford's factories 
- Operations management is applying scientific methods across the body, whether manufacturing or service 
- Do operations management have applications for startups in the digital era?
- This course will attempt to answer this question.
- We will examine fundamental operational management concepts in the context of startups
- We will debate if these concepts have applications in a rapidly changing digital marketplace
- We will examine how Amazon used these concepts to go from a small ecommerce to the world's largest marketplace 
- How did Netflix go from DVD rentals to becoming the most iconic streaming service in the world?
- We will cover these four areas:
    - Lean Management which originated in Toyota 
    - Formal decision-making methods under uncertainty
    - Process theory and challenges scaling may create for services that an organization offers 
    - Practical issues and supply chain management 

**HOW TO KNOW WHEN AND IF WE ARE SCALING** 

- What does scaling up mean? 
- Scaling up is a continuous process - not a one off 
- The process to create and the process to scale up are **different** 
- Organizational lifecycle can be mapped to that of a person - if a startup = an infant, then a scaling-up operation is the infant going into pre-teenage
- In both cases, however, stability and maturity is still not attained 
- On the surface, if startups are in the phase of exploring the right product-market fit, then scale-ups have achieved this, and now are focusing on growth 
- From a HR hiring standpoint, startups need *generalists* while scale-ups need *experts/specialists* 
- Information flow is dynamic in startups while scale-ups have information to be focused and prioritized 
- In terms of leadership, startups require a rockstar like CEO while the scale-ups require more traditional leadership styles 
- According to the World Economic Forum, scaling up is defined as 'assessing success factors in enabling a business to expand in terms of market access, revenues, added value and the number of employees, in particular, identifying and realizing win-win opportunities for collaboration between market leaders and market disruptors.'
- Scaling up are looking for growth in revenue and employee numbers 
- Scale-ups need to identify and realize win-win opportunities for collaboration with other startups and more established companies 


**Scaling Up: Metrics, Pitfalls, and Strategies**

- Some of the ways an organization signals that it is ready for scaling up the operations is through metrics: revenue, profits and number of employee are all indicators of an organization on the verge of needing to scale up 
- However there is **no consensus** 
- According to the OECD, *start-ups are in the process of scaling up when it has had at least 20% growth over the last three years 
- **Start-up Europe Partnership** defines three stages of startups: start-up, scale-up, and scaler. In this category, a scale-up has gone from raising $1 million dollars of funds in the last three years 
- What are classic mistakes organizations make when scaling up? 
- One such mistake is to *scale prematurely* 
- **Premature scaling** is when a startup substantially increases its capacity before having solid indicators that enough people are willing to buy its products or services - even in the scenario of accelerated growth, startups tend to burn cash, driven by optimism, and lack of planning 
- This is the usually the first reason companies that scale too fast without any planning fail
- On the other hand, insufficient scaling is when a business doesn't react fast enough to catch up with the growth of the business. *This is usually the result of what is called '*linear thinking*' 
- *Linear thinking* is assuming that growth is linear which it never is 
- Insufficient planning is also at the root for insufficient scaling 
- The question of 'Why is fast growth bad?' will be explored deeper in later lessons but for the timebeing let us say that too fast a growth can minimize the prospects for growth in future business stages 
- Founders, therefore, can be too hasty or too slow in scaling - both of which can be avoided through proper planning 
- Scaling can be **horizontal** or **vertical** scaling (borrowed from networking computer science to explain different ways to grow a system or network)
- The idea of horizontal and vertical scaling can be applied in the context of operations management outside of IT as well 
- *Vertical scaling is how most startups grow* - This is when growth is achieved by focusing on one market or one customer segment, getting higher demand from it. This concentrated effort result in a more efficient allocation of resources, but could increase risk of the early stage of putting all the eggs into one market
- *Horizontal scaling is about diversifying the sources of growth* - In contrast, horizontal scaling looks to diversify the sources of growth, either by tackling different markets, aiming at different customer segments, or customizing the value proposition to a segment of the market. This method of scaling up helps to diversify risk but requires signifiant flexibility and organization, especially from an operational point of view

    []- Commit to Grow
    []- Build a broad management skillset
    []- Build collaborations
    []- Establish standardized processes
    []- Identify core competence
    []- Articulate competitive strength

**Operations Management: Matching Supply with Demand** 

- In this lesson, we will learn about the role operations has in scaling up 
- Operations management at its simplest *meeting supply with demand* 
- Finance and marketing often overshadow operations 
- Operations was the critical focus for Amazon at the time they started 
- Excelling in operations management is how firms like Amazon experienced exponential growth 
- **Blue Ocean Strategy**, the famous management book, offered that innovating ways of matching supply with demand is an incredibly rich area of growth 
- What does this mean? Here are two examples. Note that these examples differ in that one of them is demand-side innovation, and the other is a supply-side innovation

   - Process innovation can lead to the decrease in unit delivery of production or distribution costs, without sacrificing quality of value proposition. Zara, for instance, by modifying existing trendy designs based on customer feedback - this way, they were able to eliminating the traditional industry method of refreshing garment design on a seasonal basis, Zora was able to achieve competitive advantage by refreshing its designs twice a month based on customer feed back 
   > **QUOTE FROM SAM**
   >
   > > To maintain these agile systems, Zora has kept its seasonal manufacturing in Spain and Morocco instead of moving their manufacturing to Asia like the rest of their competitors 

- Process innovation can also be achieved through by matching demand with supply - in this case, let's consider Netflix 
- Netflix transitioned from DVD rentals to online streaming services, by acquiring the licences from other content producers, to creating and distributing their own content. 
- In both the case of Zara and Netflix, we can see how changes in the process of delivering value to create their own blue ocean, by tailoring demand to supply 
- Service engineering involves the design and pricing of side services in order to appeal to a broader market and improve resource utilization in the company
- This can be achieved in two different ways: 
    - The first is through virtual modification to services - these are the options that affect the delivery of consumption of a product or service, without making changes to the core offering. Consider the hotel that is overbooked where the hotel manager would offer reduced rates to customers who are willing to have their reservations changed 
    - The other is the case of 'bundling' or 'unbundling' where additional services from core services and creating different versions of the same core service to appeal to different segment of the market 
    - Think about the different options airlines offer on plane tickets. In the software industry, Adobe packages its entire suite into the CC packaging while also offering each of the apps as a standalone subscription 
    - While service engineering is a relatively new concept its efficacy is promising. In the Software as a Service (SAS) sector, vendors provide different markets from students to managers with the same base product where the version and functionality differ based on use and needs

**LINEAR vs EXPONENTIAL ORGANIZATIONS**

- What are the implications of growth? 
- First we must look into the two kinds of growth - *exponential* and *linear* - Growth doesn't isn't linear 
- The idea of growth can be examined via Moore's Law who observed that the number of transistors were growing exponentially in Integrated Chips that were at the heart of computing 
- Ray Kurzweil believed that anything powered by information doubles its price-power ratio annually. He called *Law of Accelerating Returns* in which he observed that the driver fueling exponential growth patterns of technology was information. 
- Kurzweil observation has bearing in bio-tech, AI, robotics
- Exponential growth is 'one whose impact or output is disproportionately large, at least 10 times larger compared to its peers because the use of organizational techniques and leveraging accelerating technology'
- Startups such as AirBNB, Uber and Waze have followed the exponential growth trajectory 
- With exponential growth as pretext, it is important for startups to develop their scaling up capabilities  to accomodate rapid growth. One such example is *Pod Point*, an at-home electric vehicle charging port, which was one of the UK's fastest growing startups. 
- The company faced massive challenges in scaling up as processes and procedures were under pressure - linear thinking is a major problem for large organizations, but it can be devastating for startups
- Linear organizations operate under the assumption that productivity is a function of power - in other words, X amount of work takes Y amount of resources, and that the ratio is a constant. 
- In linear organizations are realized through economies of scale, and traditional practices are rarely disrupted. 
- This linear slope has been challenged by automation, mass production and new consumption patterns 
- The first key concept to accommodate exponential growth is a *shift from the linear view of owning assets, such as machinery and other capex, to a model of renting and sharing fixed assets. This is called *collaborative consumption*, coined by Rachel Botsman and Roo Rogers.
- Enterprises like FLOOOW2 have emerged where businesses can rent or share facilities, equipment, and skilled employees. 
- This leveraging of external resources allow scalability because renting non-critical assets removes the burden or owning and managing them. *Kickstarter*, for example, allows manufacturers and inventors to focus on new product ideas while simply managing the fundraising for the new product 
- Besides a shift from the linear view of owning assets, **experimentation and risk-taking are key to achieving exponential growth**

2. [The basics of Yield Mangement](https://www.wpsre.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Basics-of-Yield-Management.pdf)
3. Questions to ponder: 
    - What is Yield/Revenue Management and how it can be used to match demand with supply; 
    - What are its applications in the hotel industry? 
    - What are its risks?

**Lean Management: Origins** 

- Lean management began its operations in Toyota
- The notion of lean is based on waste elimination and lean thinking
- Because Lean encourages the elimination of waste, it has shown applicability in areas outside of manufacturing as well 
- Its application in the startup space has contributed to exponential growth 
- Lean also has applications *prior to scaling*, in that is also useful for the starting up process 
- One such way is through *experimentation* 
- Concepts from lean such as **Minimum Viable Product**, **Pivoting** and **Validated Learning** 
- Experimentation allows for a circular process that, when carried out properly, allows a company to quickly and efficiently identifying a successful product or idea 
- Since Lean encourages the elimination waste and does allow organization to move on from ineffective ideas 
- This is important for startup because of limited resources. 
- These are the steps needed to carry out a Lean Startup Methodology 
    - Create a value hypothesis 
    - Discover what target audience do you want to target, and determine what to measure in order to test your original hypothesis. If, for example, your hypothesis is off from people's preferences then you go back to the first step of the hypothesis generation 
    - If your idea is inline to continue to building a MVP 
    - This is a basic prototype of your idea, and should be scalable 
    - The next step is *testing* 
    - The key is to design a plan to test your MVP in a way that provides data or metrics to determine the success or failure of the product - if the data shows your hypothesis wasn't correct, pivot your idea to better address customer needs until product and market fit is achieved; else go back to step 1 again 
    -

![image-20210607215428757](image-20210607215428757.png)


Let's look at the above stages in detail. 

- MVP: This is a minimum set of features to prove the most essential hypothesis 
- Validated learning: Much of Amazon's success can be put down to validated learning where experimentation and results are constantly factored into a product launch. Think about Amazon using Drones for delivery - this allowed Amazon the privilege of learning from mistakes. This in turn allowed Amazon to **pivot** from bad ideas to successful ones 
- Pivoting: This allows companies to adjust an idea to better reflect current market demands and capabilities. Markets and customers are constantly changing, and companies must constantly experiment with ideas to keep up. Netflix's pivot from renting DVDs to streaming. While this gave this first mover advantage, it did bog the organization down with heavy costs arising from expensive content licences that Netflix would have to pay the original content producers. Netflix pivoted yet again, this time creating their own content

While the advantages of lean methodology is clear, it is also necessary to point out the drawbacks arising from this way of thinking:
- Paralysis by analysis 
- Testing may make you loose sight of your original strategy 
- Too much experimentation can squander mental and creative energy 
- Important to be aware of cognitive bias - driven by desire, emotion or social influence

#### Assignments 

You are the CEO and co-founder of Fitter, an online platform that provides customized fitness and eating regimes based on an analysis of full-body pictures, age, gender, ethnicity, and geographic location.

Users just need to create an account, fill in their basic information (weight and height, in addition to the previous variables) and upload five full-body pictures taken from different angles. In a matter of minutes, Fitter’s algorithm provides customized fitness and eating regimes that the customer can follow for one month. After that time, the effectiveness of the regimes is reduced; hence users must upload new pictures and update their weight data. Then Fitter provides new regimes.

Fitter monetizes its service by charging three different kinds of fees: Basic, Family, and Premium. The Basic plan costs $30 (US) per month and simply provides customers with their customized regimes. The Family plan costs $99 and provides regimes for up to five members tied to the same account. The Premium plan costs $149 and complements the customized regimes with personal follow-up, by nutrition and fitness experts, that helps customers keep on track and be more creative with the regimes. The Premium plan promises to be seven times more effective than the Basic plan.

Fitter has been active for two years and has a presence in major US cities. Over the last six months, its number of cities and users have shown significant monthly growth. Also, specialized sites (e.g., Product Hunt, TechCrunch) have talked about Fitter and the innovative approach it takes into wellness. You are wondering whether is time to scale up your operations.

**Consider the Implications of Scaling**

*Before you scale Fitter, there are many factors to consider: marketing, employees, adding new services, and so forth.*

*Briefly explain several most important factors to consider when scaling this business, the challenges that might arise, and possible ways to address these challenges.*

*Note: This portion of the exercise is less about applying what you have learned in Module 1 and more about encouraging you to think critically about all the factors that could affect a startup that is seeking to scale up.* 

I believe the following are the most important factors to consider when scaling. My answer is based on my own experience, both as a senior manager in what was Sri Lanka's largest ecommerce company (in 2012), and having co-founded my own enterprise focusing on creating content branding for large Sri Lankan advertisers 

1. Employees and organizational culture: 

I joined the e-commerce company in 2012, just as it was on the cusp of expansion. The company had initially based its business model on Groupon, which had proved to be an enormous success, and the organization was on the verge of diversifying into larger e-commerce offerings. This entailed having to add new members to the team, mostly in the operations side, but also for IT infrastructure, Human Resources, and of course finance. The addition of new employees - at one point, the company went from 72 employees to 230 plus in the space of two months - brought a whole new set of challenges. Training the new employees in the company processes was among the chief challenges, but an often overlooked part of this challenge was the pressure that new workforce would bring to organizational culture. Do we retain our startup nimbleness and open communication, or do we centralize communications much like a larger organization would? In quickly adding to the workforce, Human Resources also didn't have much time to do extensive diligence on these new employees' suitability to the demands of working in a rapidly growing startup. 

2. Infrastructure costs 

E-commerce brings a whole new set of challenges to our IT infrastructure. For instance, website loading times became an issue as the site grew from its Groupon roots to a more Amazon-like entity, offering products ranging from consumer electronics to fashion. The more the brand's name became familiar outside the urban regions of Sri Lanka, the larger the traffic became, slowing the site down to a crawl, which in turn disrupts the company's revenue generation capabilities. Scaling this to fit the needs of the increasing market while keeping costs under control was a challenge that stretched for much of my tenure there. 

3. Processes: 

Since our processes were in their infancy, it was possible to tweak it as we learnt more about the market. Once again, this constant tweaking combined with new staff being added all the time, made it extremely difficult to achieve uniformity in executing the process. 

4. Internal and External communications:  

This is related to the aforementioned point about organizational culture. Before hitting its growth phase, the company prided itself in having a small but extremely tight knit team of people who had been there from day 1 of the organization. Communications, both internally to the staff, and externally to customers and other external stakeholders, were informal in tone, irreverent even, very much keeping with the fact that the organization was young, and had large number of people under the age of 35. As it grew, these informal systems that we had used to communicate, were ill prepared to meet our needs. For instance, how do we get communicate the state of the organization? Previously, it was Weekly catchups where the CEO would share financial performance, and goals for the coming week. But as the organization grew, it was impossible to do so as time commitment of the senior management was very limited. In a similar vein, communicating with external stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, merchants, etc., was challenging. How do we retain the essence of the brand that customers had fallen for initially? How do we ensure that we communicate changes in internal processes to suppliers who were used to very different procedures? 


**As a part of your plan to scale, you are considering launching a new service to capture a wider market.**

*Your task is to develop an MVP and devise an experiment to test it. Describe your MVP and explain what makes it an MVP. Then, describe your experiment. What metrics would you use to evaluate it? What do you expect the outcome to be?* 

**FITTER PLAYTIME**

The MVP would be called **FITTER PLAYTIME**. Its basic hypothesis is that we humans are social animals, and social animals relax best when they are at play. This MVP then would add another tier to Fitter's existing tiers, but priced much lower than the $30 basic plan. This new tier would be titled Fitter Social, and allow the company to target niche of fitness market that associates fitness with playing a sport with others. Thus Fitter Social has the following MVP features:
    - Individual sport-preference
    - Location data of user
    - Location of closest sporting venue for the sport of choice 
Based on the above two variables, the system would connect users to each other. In addition, to the above, it would also offer a safety centre to ensure that users who choose to meet up in real life to play a sport they like, can do so safely. 

My experiment would start with an analysis of digital marketing data, particularly analyzing customer journey from awareness of Fitter to the point of conversion - naturally not all 100% of customers would convert/buy a package; the focus of my experiment would be to use sport as the gateway tier to the rest of Fitter's offerings. Let's assume for example that Fitter's marketing funnel shows a final conversion rate of 10% i.e. after being exposed to Fitter's online marketing, 10% of that base has purchased a package. The remaining 90% will be narrowed down further on age - i.e. between 18-45. My hypothesis is that these people are interested in fitness but require fitness pursuits that are based around playing sport. I would divide up this age group in two groups, one a control group that will be offered Fitter's existing Basic Package at a lower rate (say $20/month) while the group that is offered the Fitter Social Tier would be offered the MVP at $5/month. 


I would conduct this experiment over a quarter, and use the following metrics to ascertain its performance: 

- Total number of users / sq.mile 
- Total number of venues booked 
- Number of new users / week 
- Total revenue / month 


Sadly, your experiment and MVP were not successful. Your experiment did not generate enough traffic, and customers did not respond well to the new idea. Briefly describe what insight can be gained from your failed experiment and propose a way to pivot your idea.

Note: It is up to you to determine what went wrong with the MVP. There are no wrong or right answers. Rather, it is important to provide a viable reason why your experiment did not work and to describe what can be learned from this failed experiment.

**POINT OF FAILURE** 
Not enough critical mass on the app via the new tier. 

**REASON FOR FAILURE**
My hypothesis - i.e. that sport is a social gateway to individual fitness - was proved wrong, as few people chose to use the social functionality to find partners for playing sports. 

**INSIGHT**
The data and customer feedback indicated that there was a vital element missing - i.e. the ability to gauge skill level of a sport. For instance very skilled amateur tennis player would often end up being paired with a beginner, resulting in a frustrating experience for both.


## WEEK 2 Decision Making Under Uncertainty 

**UNCERTAINTY**

- In this module we will talk mostly about uncertainty 
- Uncertainty in the face of scaling up operations 
- We will use managerial techniques that help us manage uncertainty 
- We will talk at great length about project management tools that can be used to manage uncertainty 
- Uncertainty is as part of modern organizations as the prospect of exponential growth 
- Uncertainty can come in the form of political, economic, technological and other factors where control is minimized 
- Uncertainty can also manifest in the form of people, market issues, costs, scheduling, quality problems 
- Uncertainty can be defined as **situations where the outcome of a particular event or set of events deviates from a certain outcome or value**
- Startups are generally more susceptible to uncertainty than larger, more well established firms 
- Generally, the smaller the firm, the faster they tend to grow, but the pay off is that they would face more uncertainty 
- Smaller firms have less cash to tool to spend on risk management 
- Risk management can be done as follows:
    - Acknowledge risk 
    - Have a plan 
        - strategy 
        - action plan 
        - implementation 
        - scheduling 
        - collaboration 
        - objectives 
        - improvements
- In the context of scaling, it is important to break down each stage of the process and evaluate any possible uncertainty along the way 
- One of the most effective ways to minimize uncertainty is to use teamwork
- Stakeholder management is an important part of uncertainty and rick management 
- There are four kinds of uncertainty
    - **Variation** - This can be defined as natural *changes in a single variable*. For example, few processes can be expected to deliver the exact expected performance at all times - no customer service center can answer all calls in exactly two minutes, for example. Such variability can be inefficient and result in poor process performance. The key in such cases is to use formal methods, including statistical controls to control the slippage in budget, schedule and deliverables in order to get project back on track  
    - **Foreseen** - these kinds of uncertainty are generally *scenarios that can be planned for but are not guaranteed to occur*. This is like a flipping a coin. Consider pharmaceutical drugs for example - because doctors would have risk profiles available at all time, they can then plan for side-effects if any. It is important to identify what occurrences could happen to affect the project.  
                                - **Unforeseen** - These kinds of uncertainty, in contrast, are scenarios where outcomes can't be identified with precision during the planning stages. In these cases, it is impossible to create contingency plans - risk management, therefore, must evolve as time progresses and more is known. This is kind of uncertainty is most applicable for startups or firms operating in emerging markets. Flexibility is the key to manage such kinds of uncertainty - flexible contracts, strong team, and strong management support are essential to managing this kind of uncertainty Flexibility is the key to manage such kinds of uncertainty - flexible contracts, strong team, and strong management support are essential to managing this kind of uncertainty. In this sense, the small size and relative nimbleness of startups - where flexibility is the norm - navigating unforeseen uncertainty is easier than it would be for larger organizations where structures and processes are rigid.One of the more famous examples of this is Twitter who originally were supposed to be a podcasting platform but was quickly required to pivot when Apple released iTunes with podcasting built-in. The twitter team then broke into hackathons, which finally resulted in the micro-blogging platform that we know today. 
    - **Chaos** - In this kind of uncertainty all factors are constantly changing and variation is the norm. The tech industry is the perfect example of this. Rapid changes in technology require R&D is one of the best means of navigating chaotic environments. The key is to have a number of different approaches either in a series or in parallel in the form of experimentation. MVPs and experimentation are among the best tools to use in such type of uncertainty. 

None of the above kinds of uncertainty are isolated or happen in isolation. Instead, most businesses will have to navigate one or a multiple kinds of uncertainty at various points. Being flexible, cautious, and adaptable is crucial, but just as crucial is the need to prioritize the different kinds of uncertainty based on their consequences. To do so, we can categorize uncertainty into one of four quadrants as below:

#### FURTHER READING 

1. [Strategy Under Uncertainty](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/strategy-under-uncertainty)


**MEASURING AND REPRESENTING UNCERTAINTY** [//]: # (This section requires relearning statistics from the basics - especially the idea of mode, median, and mean, as well as probability, and probibility distribution function)

- In this module we are going to measure uncertainty
- this involves using statistical methods 
- There are important terminology used when we talk about uncertainty 
    - **Random variables** - These are attributes where *outcome is uncertain*. These random variables have well defined set of outcomes - either discrete or continuous - and well defined probabilities. A random variable is usually represented by a probability distribution function, its **mean**, and its **variance**. *A probability distribution function assigns probabilities to each possible outcome - for example, it we consider tossing a dice, the random variable is the number that will turn up*. In the case of a dice, the probability distribution will assign a probability of 1/6th. 
    
      ![image-20210610221342555](image-20210610221342555.png)
- A mean or the average of this random variable is calculated as the summation of the product of all possible outcomes, and their probabilities. In the case of the die, the equation would be defined as follows: 
  
    > (1/6*1)+(1/6*2)+(1/6*3)+(1/6*4)+(1/6*5)+(1/6*6) = 3.5
- Note that the answer of **3.5** above represents a figure that never appears in a dice - this implies that the *mean or **expected value** may never represent the actual outcome* 
- This random variable have *variance* - variance is the spread between oytcomes of a random variable, or in simpler terms, *variance measures how far each possible outcome or value is from the mean of the variable.*
- The bigger the variance, the wider the distance between each possible value and its mean, which results in less consistency in results and more uncertainty
- Consider the example of measuring your average monthly sales growth rate over a two year period. If you are preparing your marketing budget based on the available extra cash you will have from the growth - say 5% - you will still need to consider the uncertainty associated with it - using a measure of this uncertainty such as variance. In this case, a high variance means that it is probable that you will fall short some months but have excess budget in other months. On the other hand, a variance close to zero means that *you have steady growth, and that you can plan accordingly.


**FORECASTING** 

- Forecasting tools allow you to predict the possible values of random variables, their mean and variance 

- Forecasting uses historic data or judgement to predict future trends 

- Qualitative or Quantitative methods can be used to achieve this 

- It is important to note that none of these forecasting methods *look to give exact number for an uncertain value, but rather, a distribution of possible figures* 

- **Qualitative Methods** can help startups predict customer behaviour and sales patterns based on judgement, experience and opinion* - these include customer expectations, opinions of sales people, and group brainstorming 

- **The Delphi Method** is a qualitative method that can help *transform **unforeseen uncertainty** into **foreseen uncertain***

- It was developed during the Cold War - it was developed using the RAND thinktank 

- It is primarily used today for technological forecasting, and policy-making 

- Through a few rounds of questions of experts, and use of those consensus opinions as the bedrock upon which to make decision-making 

- Another important aspect of qualitative methods is the innate psychological biases present in human cognition 

- One concept that can damage forecasting results is a phenomenon called **groupthink**

- Groupthink is a term to describe the phenomenon of groups going down irrational paths 

- One of the ways to reduce the psychological biases of groupthink coming into qualitative forecasting methods is to conduct interviews individually, and not in a group 
L
- **Quantitative Methods** of forecasting is useful for tangible data points such as historical performance numbers 

- Startups can, for instance, use quantitative methods in the scaling up phase to forecast revenue sales and inventory levels based on their previously generated data 

- The drawback is that the assumption that past trends will continue unchanged into the future 

- The statistical method to overcome this drawback is **Regression Analysis** 

- Regression analysis is probably the most important of the quantitative methods in forecasting because it allows us to mathematically estimate the relation between two or more variables - for example, how much ice cream do we sell when the temperature is above a certain threshold?

![image-20210613230407849](image-20210613230407849.png)

- Let us consider the above three diagrams: the first one shows a regression arrow that has a steep incline, while the other shows a flat line. An arrow pointing upwards would mean that (in the above case) sales go up as NASDAQ performance goes down, while the arrow pointing flat indicates that there may be no effect. In the same way, the final graph showing a downward pointing arrow is indicative of a negative

### SUMMARY 
- Correlation is not causation 
- There is a host of variables acting on the variable that you are focused on sometimes simultaneously - it is important to study and understand how each of these variables interact, and to do so requires the use of more sophisticated tools

**BUSINESS TOOLS TO MAKE DECISIONS UNDER UNCERTAINTY** 

- Natural for entrepreneurs to be positive to the point of delusionality 

- Decision trees are one of the more useful quantitative tools to make decisions under uncertainty 

- **Expected Monetary Value** (EMV) 

- EMV is the expected value of possible monetary outcomes that can be calculated just like the mean of a random variable 

  ![image-20210613232414155](image-20210613232414155.png)

- On the surface, it looks like Morocco should be the logical choice - however, note that this doesn't take into account all the factors that might make one or the other more favourable; as a manager, you are expected to make a decision that is robust under different contingencies 

- In such situations, decision-trees can be extremely useful 

  ![image-20210613232936259](image-20210613232936259.png)

 - In addition to Decision Trees, **Monte-Carlo Simulations** are also useful, utilizing random variables and probability distribution to simulate different scenarios and present decision-makers with a wider view of the robustness of the decisions that can be taken under different scenarios

#### PRACTICE QUIZ 

You have three options: 

- [ ]  you enter aggressively
- [ ] you enter to the market cautiously
- [ ] you don’t enter

**Before entering the new market, you have the option of running a survey, and see if the new market is favorable.**

```python
If results.survey = positive
then prob.success = high (but not 100%).
```

```python
If results.survey = negative
then prob.success = lower (but not 0%)
```

Assume survey.cost = **$10,000**. 

- An aggressive entry to a favorable market has a big payoff, estimated to be **$200,000**
- An aggressive strategy into an unfavorable market is costly, and will lead to a loss of **$180,000**
- A cautious entry into the market is less rewarding if the market is favorable (**$100, 000**)
- A cautious entry will cause less losses if the market is unfavorable (**-$20,000**) 

 You use the following decision tree for making the entry decision. The probabilities of favorable and unfavorable market given survey predictions, based on forecasts, are given on the tree.


**PROJECT MANAGEMENT**

- Project management is essential for startups
- Project is any initiative with an objective for a defined period of time
- Project management is resource management for the completion of tasks to reach a goal within a certain period of time 
- All projects need clear objectives but these aren't always easy to determine 
- Project plans determine the clearest course of action for the completion of a project 
- Cast our minds back to the earlier Product Development course, and think about the workflow typically followed for these processes 
- 71% of new product development projects were delayed because product requirements weren't clearly defined during the planning stage 
- Product requirements sometimes change halfway through due to pivoting for example 
- Project management has three phases 

![image-20210614002644151](image-20210614002644151.png)

**PROJECT MANAGEMENT PHASE 1: PLANNING** 

- Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- Deliverable oriented hierarchical deconstruction of the work needed to completed by a project team 

- The following is a WBS by Netflix for a project started in 2008 to move from the local data centers to the cloud. This may have looked like the following:  

  ![image-20210614003114255](image-20210614003114255.png)

- The lower the task is in the hierarchy are called *work packages*
- Some tasks are *dependencies* 

![image-20210614003441368](image-20210614003441368.png)


#### READING 

[Work Breakdown Structure: 10 Rules to Make It Perfect](https://blog.masterofproject.com/work-breakdown-structure-rules/)

**THE CRITICAL PATH METHOD (CPM)** 

- CPM is an algorithm to calculate the longest path to complete all necessary tasks of a project 
- CPM requires three pieces of information:
    - Determine all necessary tasks for the project using the WBS 
    - Understand the dependencies among each task using the GANTT 
    - Estimate the duration of each task using the Delphi 

![image-20210614005713327](image-20210614005713327.png)

- A pertinent question here is *Can we shorten the critical path to buy more time for the project?* 
- The answer is yes but here we wade into another aspect of project management i.e. tradeoffs 
- One way to shorten critical paths is to consider the trade off between time and resources, which creates a tradeoff between time and cost. Another less obvious tradeoff is between time and efficiency 
- This course of compressing the critical path is called **Project Crashing** 
- There are four steps to Project Crashing 
    - Find the critical path and identify critical activities 
    - Compute *the time unit crash cost* for each activity by the following formula: Crash Cost/Time Period = Cost to Crash - Normal Cost / Normal Time - Time to Crash 
    - Choose the critical activity with the smallest crash cost / unit of time
    - Make sure the critical path is still critical 

![image-20210614010741778](image-20210614010741778.png)

**RESOURCE ALLOCATION AND BUDGETING** 

- Resource allocation for a startup is essential 
- It should be strategic value to your organizations 
- Key resources in terms of scaling up for startups are employees, cash, and technology. In some cases, fixed assets such as office buildings and furniture are also part of this 
- During the planning stage, WBS and CPM will help you answer key questions with regard to resources: Are we under-resourced or over-resourced? Are resources affected by parallel work? Do people have the required skills and tools to perform the tasks? Do we reassign or obtain more resources
- You can map resource allocation using visualization tools such as GANTT charts 
- An important resource for projects is budgeting 
- A budget is more than allocation of money 
- It is a strategic financial tool 
- A project budget is a detailed and time-phased estimate of all resource costs. This can be as follows:

INITIAL ROUGH ESTIMATE >>>>>> DETAILED ESTIMATE >>>>>>> FINISHED AND APPROVED 

- Budgeting for startups require the following:
    - Understanding cash flow 
    - Outline current labour and equipment needs 
    - Access current budget 
    - Align budget with development goals 
    
- A comprehensive budget for a project will only develop as a result of detailed scheduling and resource planning 

- WBS is a good starting point for budgeting 

- In the case of the WBS, there are two approaches: **TOP DOWN** and **BOTTOM-UP** 

  ![image-20210614191814084](image-20210614191814084.png)

![image-20210614191906162](image-20210614191906162.png)

- In the above diagrams, we show the contrasting approaches to using the WBS for budgeting. 
- In the **Bottom-Up** approach, we start with the cost of the individual items needed to complete the lower level tasks, gradually making our way up the WBS hierarchy, in order to arrive at the overall budget for the project
- In the Top-down approach, we start at the highest level work - i.e. *overall budget for the project*, and proportionally allocate a percentage of the overall budget to individual tasks and work packages
- What if we don't have resources whenever you need them? *Constrained cash flow* is a real issue for startups 
- The WBS' innate visual nature allows us to 'see' where resource are being over-utilized. Consider the example below:

![image-20210614192629709](image-20210614192629709.png)

- We can see above that the tasks 'New Platform' and 'Data Import' are overlapping to a large degree in month 2. 
- The WBS utility comes to the fore here, as it shows this at the planning stage. As managers, we can now take the call to move the Data Import part of the project to month 3, ensuring that we don't burn out our resources 


## WEEK 3 Process Theory 

- In this module we will cover **Process Theory** 
- Processes are key to the success of startups 
- A process is a set of tasks that must be performed in sequence 
- We will examine the process of the French startup *Point Vision* who are in the market for spectacles 
- The goal of process improvement is to provide a product or service that is to *make it quicker*, *improve quality*, *lower costs*, and *maximize value* 
- In order to make these improvements, processes should be well understood 
- Processes can be visualized using **Process Flow Diagrams** 
- The flow of the process is sequential 
- In process theory, **flow units** are goods and materials that are manufactured and assembled to eventually become a final product 
- In a service context such as Point Vision flow units are patients seeking eye care 
- In an administrative context, say for university admissions, applications are the flow units 
- Some processes are parallel, this is especially true in manufacturing 
- There are 3 performance measures for improvement 
    - **Throughput time** - this is defined as the *time that a flow unit spends in a process* 
    - **Throughput rate** - this is defined as *the rate at which one flow unit goes through the process*. Inn the case of Point Vision, this is defined as number of patients seen in a unit of time 
    - **Inventory** - this is defined as *the number of flow units waiting to move forward*. In this case of Point Vision, number of patients sitting in the waiting room, awaiting their appointments 

- Note that inventory is seen differently in manufacturing and service sectors. In the former, this is raw material - i.e. flow units - that are waiting to move forward in the process; in the service sector, it is people waiting to be served - this is true in hospitals, in customer service centers, etc., 
- Thus we can summarize Process Improvement as having the following goals
    - *Decrease Throughput Time* 
    - *Increase Throughput Rate* 
    - *Decrease Inventory* 

- Point Vision case allows us to ponder how they achieved the above three goals of process improvement 
- To decrease Throughput Time, an organization can *decrease the flow time of tasks so that there is an overall reduction in time taken for process to complete 
- In the case of Point Vision, the organization standardized the check-in process, and utilized technology in the optometry process help reduce overall time per patient, thus reducing the entire time it takes to see an ophthalmologist; this is their **competitive advantage**
- To reduce the process time, companies can also restructure the entire process to remove any unnecessary tasks - Point Vision restructured the vision care process to have orthotists do 70% of the patient work, and ophthalmologist to do 30%; this allowed the doctors to see more patients per day 
- Another way to decrease process time to is the decrease in waiting time between actions: What happens when, in the case of Point Vision, patients don't arrive for their appointment on time? 
- Processes, especially for startups, can be fluid (even unstructured) 
- The basic starting point of understanding processes is a Process Flow Diagram or other visualization tools

### Process Capacity and Bottlenecks 

- Process capacity is the maximum rate is the maximum possible Throughput Rate 
- Consider the process chart of Point Vision 

![image-20210618191434572](image-20210618191434572.png)

![image-20210618191505035](image-20210618191505035.png)

![image-20210618191533789](image-20210618191533789.png)

![image-20210618191603492](image-20210618191603492.png)

- Considering the theoretical process chart of Point Vision (above), how many patients and hour can be serviced by the overall process chart? 

- Is it the average of the capacities of the various steps in the overall process? No it isn't the average

- To answer the question, Process Design has to take into account bottlenecks in the process 

- *Bottlenecks* is defined as the process activity with the smallest capacity 

- From the above charts, we can see that the check-in has the lowest capacity - this is therefore the bottleneck in the process

- The key concept to remember in Process Design is **the process capacity is equal to the capacity of its weakest link** 

- In the case of Vision Point, the  process capacity is therefore, 15 - as this is the number of patients that the check-in can accommodate an hour 

- Remember that a process capacity can *never be higher than its bottleneck* 

- Redesigning the above process chart to increase efficiency can't be done by hiring more staff - a more effective approach is to identify the bottleneck and invest resources in improving capacity with that activity, and that activity alone 

- Additionally, also important to understand that bottlenecks aren't necessarily the most important part of the process 

  ![image-20210618193301151](image-20210618193301151.png)

- It is also important to note that if the demand is greater than the capacity, **the Throughput Rate (or flow rate) is equal to capacity of the process** 

  ![image-20210618194124316](image-20210618194124316.png)

![image-20210618194655293](image-20210618194655293.png)

- You will notice that the resource with **the highest utilization is the bottleneck** 
- The concept of Bottlenecks was first examined in the *Theory of Constraints*, a conceptual theory that was introduced by Dr Eliyahu Goldratt** in 'The Goal'
- Dr Goldratt focused on five steps of successful businesses 
    - **IDENTIFY**: This constraint can be physical (equipment) or non-physical (company policy for example)
    - **EXPLOIT**: Plan for the overcoming of these constraints
    - **SUBORDINATE**: Focus resources into putting Step 2 (above) into action 
    - **ELEVATE**: Minimize the constraint by expanding capability or reducing the amount of work done by those affected 
    - **REPEAT**: Go back to Step 1 (IDENTIFY) as new bottlenecks may have arisen 
- As you can see, the Theory of Constraints is a continuous improvement process

- [How to Manage Processes with the Theory of Constraints](http://www.dummies.com/business/operations-management/how-to-manage-processes-with-the-theory-of-constraints/)


### The Effect of Variability in Processes 

- When discussing processes, we think of Throughput Rate and other variables as being constant - i.e. the average unit to carry out a task 
- Moving from theory to pragmatic issues faced by management, we see there is rarely constants, variability and uncertainty are the norms facing businesses and their respective processes 
- In module two, we learnt about uncertainty, specifically uncertainty from the supply-side. What about uncertainty that arises from the demand side? 
- Variability and uncertainty can have an effect on processes, resulting in queues (queues can be applicable to both service and manufacturing, in the same way the notion of *inventory* can be applied in both manufacturing and service)
- Consider the example of Point Vision: Uncertainty from the demand side can arise from when customers come in either early for their appointment, or by arriving late for the appointment. How can the processes that we create accommodate such uncertainty? 
- If the average Throughput Time for a patient at the Point Vision clinic is 45 mins (again worth bearing in mind that this is an **average**), this average will be tested by both demand and supply side variability 
- The result of variability in demand and supply side can result in waiting (queues or unutilized inventory)
- Think about the formation of queues in supermarkets, airports, banks, etc., 
- Process refinement has a single goal in reducing queues 
- Queueing theory seeks to examine what underlying factors - both from a demand and a process side - cause queues
- **AK Erlang** developed a mathematical model to understand how flow units move through a system with queues
- In the case of startups, most processes will have queues of intangible flow units in the form of work-in-progress. For example, think of unread email regarding a task 


### Little's Law 

- Little's Law has implication for startups 
- Little's Law explores the **mathematical relationship that exists between Throughput Rate, Throughput Time, and Inventory**

![image-20210619185056945](image-20210619185056945.png)

- Little Law definition: *Little’s law states that the average number of items within a system is equal to the average arrival rate of items into and out of the system multiplied by the average amount of time an item spends in the system.*
    - From the above diagram
        - *I* = **Inventory** 
        - *R* = **Throughput Rate** 
        - *T* = **Throughput Time** 
- Let us consider the following example that examines HEC's Masters' Programme to examine Little's Law in more detail 
    - The duration of the programme is **2 Years**, *which makes **T=2**
    - Admitted Students is **400 students**, which makes **R=2**
    - Therefore, **I=800** 
- Now consider the implications of variability. From the above HEC example, would the average inventory be different if the year to year intake number changes but the average remains the same?
- No it wouldn't. This is because **Little's Law holds true even with variability** 
- Consider if the Avg. Duration of the programme = 1.5 or 2.5 years **Little's Law holds true even with variability** 
- Now applying Little's Law to Point Vision: if there were 45 patients coming in at any point (**R**), and the Average Time they stayed (**45 mins (0.74 h)**), then there'd be **48 patients per hour** (65*.75=48) waiting for their turn 
- Using Little's Law you can find out **T**, by rearranging the formula so that it'd be **I/R=T**
- As you can see, this universal law has clear implications
    - You can't get rid of inventory, managing inventory is essential to any business, be they service or manufacturing 
    - You can only change two simultaneously; the third is uncertain. For example, if **R** increases, and **T** remains constant then **I** will go up 
- What does this mean to scaling up? If, in the process of scaling up, your **R** value goes up, **T** must be also brought down so that **I** remains at a reasonable level. This is true for manufacturing and services; in the case of the latter, it means keeping your SLAs to customers/clients at a rate they've come to expect from you 
- Management can use Little's Law to gain insights about the most pertinent indicators of traction and scalability. 
- It's important, however, that when applying the law to your business, that focus on the performance indicators that are most salient to your business model and value proposition

### The Waiting Time Formula 
- Waiting time is a result of variability in the arrival and service processes 
- For this we are going to once again examine the case of Point Vision
    - **Demand side**: 2 processes: *Entry* and *Service* 
    
    - **Total time a flow unit spends in the system = Time in the queue + Service Time**
    
    - Note that both **Time in Queue** *and* **Service Time** *are* *variable* 
    
    - What then are determinants of the average waiting time? 
        - *A simple mathematical formula by Felix Pollaczek and Aleksandr Khinchin aims to answer this question. Often referred to as the *P-K Formula*. This formulate postulates that there are three factors that affect the average waiting time in a simple queues. The formula shown below can be read as: **The average service time, the time it takes for the service to be performed, the system utilization (Flow Rate / Capacity), and variability associated with the arrival and service pricesses - represented by their associated coefficients of variation, variance of random variable divided by its mean**. This can be seen in two kinds of restaurants - fast food vs dine-in
        - In the case of Fast Food restaurants, the processes have been optimized for less waiting. 
        - Both cases highlight the Waiting Time Formula and Queueing Theory being interpreted, and applied in different ways that support the business model and value proposition 

      ![image-20210619232746674](image-20210619232746674.png)
    
    - How to measure, and manage the average waiting time? 
        - Ways to decrease waiting times include reduction of system utilization: the formula above highlights how increasing the utilization factor in the P-K Formula, can lead to higher waiting; keeping all constant, the waiting time will be infinite as the utilization of the system gets closer to one 
        
        - If the coefficients of variation are greater than zero, the process cannot manage to have full utilization - if you want to keep waiting times reasonably low then system utilization has to be way below one. In such cases, this implies adding extra capacity in order to keep waiting times low 
        
        - Finally, when uncertainty with respect to arrival process or service processes, as measured by coefficient of variation of inter-arrival and service times increases, this uncertainty also increases waiting time. Notice the equation below isn't linear but quadratic. This means that **if the uncertainty in arrival and service process doubles, the total average waiting time increases by a factor of four.**
        
          ![image-20210619234535806](image-20210619234535806.png)
        
        - The final way to reduce waiting times is to reduce uncertainty - both in arrival and service processes. In the case of Point Vision, for example, the company has a strict scheduling process for patients' arrival - i.e. the standardization of the process is largely meant to reduce the variability of service times 

- Queueing systems of any sort will **have to balance a trade off between scaling up and service experience**. In the case of the Point Vision this entailed lowering system utilization
- In businesses that rely on a value proposition that is centered around user experience (i.e. lower waiting times as in the case of fast food). In such cases, the trade off should be significant investment in increasing capacity or better utilization of limited resources 
- It is also important to **narrow down the sources of variability** - once identified, controlling them becomes the focus

## WEEK 4 Retail Operations and Their Challenges

- Successful retail operations involve answering three basic questions:
    - Who 
    - What 
    - When 
    - How much?
- From process and optimization standpoint, the following are operational areas within retail are the most important
    - **Inventory**: Arguably this is the most important part of retail operations. Most modern retail choose not to keep inventory to reduce costs and keep operations flexible - this is part of the lean management thinking. In the case of Amazon, (and Anything.lk) they'd purchase the books on behalf of the customer, mail it through the fulfillment center, and ship it to customer immediately. This is fine but as operations scale, such processes have to mature in order to ensure availability of books as more customers bring their business to you. In the case of Amazon, short fulfillment times were part of their core proposition, which meant that *having inventory* became essential. Achieving this is done through **ABC Analysis** which divides the inventory into three categories 
        - **A** which is *5-10% of the inventory that account for the 70-80% of the sales volume*
        - **B** which is *10-20% of the inventory that account for 10-15% of the sales volume* 
        - **C** which is is *70-80% of the inventory that account for 5-10% of sales volume* 
    - Logistics: Efficient and effective movement of goods and services from point A to B. 
    - Cash-flow management: **Negative operating cycle** is a tactical means with which you enable receiving payment from customers as soon as possible, but delay paying your suppliers as much as possible. This allowed Amazon to have a distinct advantage over its competition in the book retail market such as Barnes and Noble. Amazon's repayment period for its suppliers was on average **46 days** which allowed for the company to utilize the cash received from sales
    - Employee-management: Brick and mortar operations' largest non-product costs are accounted for by employees. This means that hiring the right staff is essential part of the puzzle of retail operations that need to be solved. Hiring all-round workers who display flexibility and initiative can add much needed flexibility into the operations but also add to the customer experience 
    - Offline-online integration: The line that separates online and offline operations can become blurred in e-commerce retail operations. We see this phenomenon play out where traditional retailers have been expanding their operations online, while digital and online-first retailers are attempting to get a foothold in the physical retail market as well. In such cases, it is imperative to create an retail experience where the online and offline customer journey to purchase is as uniform as possible; a disconnect can be disastrous to the overall business

### Brick and Mortar Retail Staff Management 

- Employee management and scheduling are critical components of the retail management puzzle 
- This is especially true in the case of retail startups
- Brick and mortar startups are generally speaking the most successful businesses 
- Think of Starbucks which began with a single storefront in Seattle to its status today as a global franchise giant 
- In the same way, physical presence has proved to be invaluable for digital first businesses that deal with physical goods - Amazon's recent opening of physical stores, including groceries, serves to truly underscore this point
