## TOBACCO FREE ZONES: A PATHWAY TO A TOBACCO FREE SRI LANKA 

## Executive Summary 


- 20,000 Sri Lankan lives are lost every year due to tobacco related illnesses 
- Despite repeated policy measures to curb tobacco usage in the country, there remains a high prevalence of tobacco smoking among certain groups of people 
- Smoking cessation programs and policies play a large role in curbing tobacco usage 
- Sri Lanka has a wide range of cessation programs including education and awareness programs, training programs for various groups of stakeholders, and counselling programs and a toll-free national hotline to aid quitting 
- Previous IPS studies have highlighted two important points in tobacco smoking cessation:
    - an unmet demand for tobacco cessation programs in the country 
    - community-based smoking cessation interventions are more suitable in the Sri Lankan context 
- The objective of this study, therefore, is to recognize and propose a Tobacco-Free Zone (TFZ) as a policy measure for tobacco cessation in Sri Lanka 
- We aim to answer three questions 
    - **What are the evidence in the literature on the effectiveness of the TFZ model?**
    - **What is the effectiveness of the current TFZ programs in Sri Lanka?** 
    - **What are the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to the current TFZ program?**
- We use a qualitative approach to answer the above questions 


- The literature review suggests that the concept of the TFZ is practiced in many countries and has become an important tool in curbing smoking prevalence among smokers, as well as proving itself to be a critical tool in protecting non smokers from second and third hand smoking 
- TFZs have also shown to be highly effective in curbing smoking among youth, helping 'delay' smoking initiation 
- The literature review also suggests engaging with the community, ensuring full cooperation of the members of communities, and thereafter, empower them, to ensure the success of the TFZ 


### STRENGTHS 
- Wide community and stakeholder acceptance 
- Low cost 
- Ability to reach a larger audience at once 
- Simplicity and community empowerment done through the TFZ 

### WEAKNESSES  

- lack of support and dedication from all members of the community 
- lack of adequate technical competencies among those who are involved in the program, such as PHIs
- High dependency falls on the shoulders of the PHIs 
- Unavailability of legal supporting mechanism to help PHIs due to interference from the tobacco industry 
- Lack of monitoring and evaluation of the program 

### OPPORTUNITIES 

- Recognition as an effective model of community based behavioural intervention 
- Dedication of PHIs to these communities to enforce the program 
- Learning from other programs 
- Possibility of attraction external funding from other stakeholders such as the MoH, ADIC (Alcohol and Drug Information Center) and Center for Combating Tobacco (CCT) 


### THREATS 

- Tobacco company's influence on stakeholders including PHIs, shop owners 
- Sustaining momentum among stakeholders
- Gaps in the existing tobacco control laws and regulations 
- Smokers
- Tobacco cultivators 
- Peer pressure and cultural pressure arising from media consumption



#### RECOMMENDATIONS 

- **Strengthen and expand TFZs** - Since earlier implementation of the TFZs have shown positive outcomes, expansion of TFZs would be accepted among a wide cross section of society 
- **Getting more active participation of the community members and delegations of responsibilities** - The TFZs should be driven by communities themselves; ensuring sustained motivation is imperative. We recommend therefore a training programs to empower community members to become a better ambassadors of the program, in ensuring its continued and long term success 
- **Identifying and resolving bottlenecks** - Enhancing technical capacity and providing legal support to the PHIs, getting dedicated community members to help PHIs with TFZ-related matters, are important mitigation strategies that can ensure smooth operation of the program over time 
- **Costing** - TFZs require comparatively little investment at the implementation and operational stages of the program. However, since no prior costing has been done on TFZs, it is crucial this costing and feasibility study be carried out at the earliest 
- **Monitoring and evaluation** - Since no measurement frameworks exist to evaluate the effectiveness of the current TFZs, it is recommended we use tools such as *log frame* to be used to improve planning, implementation, management, monitoring, and evaluation. 
- **Ensuring sustainability** - Current implementations of TFZs are highly dependent on the PHIs, which in turn affects the long term sustainability of TFZs - to address this issue, strong community engagement and empowerment is recommended 
- **Facing industry interferences** - Interferences from the industry has included threats and harassment of PHIs, as well as bribes. Training these stakeholders in managing these interferences, as well as education on what legal recourse they have, are essential in combating this phenomenon.

What is the evidence of TFZs effectiveness? 

TFZs have shown great success in many countries, including India, Maldives, Indonesia, Australia, and the United States of America. Bhutan is the world's most tobacco-free nation. While cultural context differs, each of these nations' experiments with TFZs have highlighted the importance of community engagement and empowerment.
