   # CULTURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN OPEN SOURCE 

Cast your mind to [October 5th, 1991] (https://www.zdnet.com/article/twenty-years-of-linux-according-to-linus-torvalds/). A young Linus Torvold released version 0.02 of his new kernel for a Unix-like operating system, freely to the public. 

About 400 years earlier, in what is modern Germany, a theologian named Martin Luther was sequestered in a castle, and, as any learned person at the time would do, he turned to the Bible; eventually, he realized the Bible, written as it was in Latin/Ancient Greek/Hebrew (there is scholarly disagreement over what language he translated from), was inaccessible to the common German people. His translation - and then subsequent philosophical and theological disagreements with the Catholic Church, led to a breakaway branch of Christianity that is referred to today as the Protestant branch. 

Of course, neither Torvold nor Luther would have known the sheer impact their decisions would have on the world at large. Today, Christianity is a 
belief system that has branched away from the philosophical tenets of the Roman Catholic to
create a diverse and distinct set of philosophical and ideological sub-branches of their own. In
the same way, Torvold's belief that powerful computing afforded by a Unix-like operating system had to be free, open and accessible to those who want to use and adapt it, has led to a proliferation of
Linux-based computing systems that can be found in servers, phones, laptops, and everywhere in
between. 

Both men undertook a difficult task - one in translating a Bible from a foreign
language to the native tongue of his people, the other in reverse-engineering (for want of a
better phrase) and opening the code base of his attempt at a Unix-like OS - because they
believed in access for all, not just for a select few; it seems to me this was a fundamental part
of what made them *them*. 

I would argue it was deeper than that.

Culture has always been open. 

The Intellectual Property (IP) legal landscape that we find now find ourselves in - affecting how and where we consume movies and music, the choices we make on
what devices and platforms we perform our computing tasks on, the affordability of text books, even the availability of the
technical research and knowledge needed to replicate vaccines to address Covid19 -is a
relatively recent phenomenon, a [by-product of capitalism and the Industrial
Revolution](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25592423?seq=1)[^1]. 

This openness of knowledge and in ideology that typifies the open source movement finds parallels
in other cultures and religions too. For instance, Hinduism - the most decentralized and open of all religions - has a
wide and diverse pantheon of Gods and Goddesses, some having cache among a large cross section of
Hindus scattered across borders and linguistic lines - while others resonate to people from a certain area. In its entry under Hinduism,[Britannica Encyclopedia] (https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hinduism) notes: *"More strikingly than any other major religious community, Hindus
accept—and indeed celebrate—the organic, multileveled, and sometimes pluralistic nature of their
traditions.* Part of that sentence could describe the state of Linux Desktop, fragmented as it is
with a whole world of Distributions, Desktop Environments, Window Managers, and Display Managers. 

In mythology, the story of an abandoned child found by a kind couple is a recurring one. This
couple raise this abandoned child on their own, but as he grows older, the couple realizes that
there is an inexplicable air to the young man. There is an almost divine presence to him that
draws people to him; as he grows into a man, he becomes a talismanic figure to his people, and
eventually his nation. Even after his apparent death, the boy's legend continues to grow - village
to village, town to town, city to city, country to country. Somehow the legend survives the
ravages of time, space, and changing tastes. 

You are all familiar with this story. 

Depending on who you are and where you come from, this is either the story of Krishna, Clarke
Kent/Superman, Luke Skywalker. Or Hercules. Or Neo from the Matrix. The pedants among you will
point out the differences between those characters' backstories - and yes, there are plenty of
distinct details to each story - but the structure (what Joseph Campbell called 'The Hero's
Journey) and the elements are strikingly similar. Here we see again how an openness of spirit and
substance that led to rich, distinct stories that adapted to their people, the time, and space. 

To my eyes, this is no different to the *scratch your own itch* mentality that has fed the OSS
ecosystem - only one is to solve computing problems, the other is to facilitate storytelling. 


Seen from this perspective, the ideals of open knowledge and sharing isn't new, but timeless. OSS
has only served to remind us of this fact. It is fascinating then to see the spirit of open
knowledge and sharing influencing academic institutions, non-personal public data collection
agencies (Central Banks and such), researchers give momentum to
