**ABOUT AC GRAYLING** 

In May 2021 A.C. Grayling ,founder of New College of the Humanities,  came to Intelligence Squared to take us on a journey through the history of science, psychology and history itself. In a special lecture drawing from his new book Frontiers of Knowledge he will describe how each field has advanced to where it is now: from the rise of technology to quantum theory; from the dawn of humanity to debates around national histories; from ancient ideas about the brain to modern theories of the mind.


### NOTES 

    - Theme: Explosion of knowledge in science, history, and thinking about the mind: what are the implications of this new phenomenon? 
    - Until recently, we didn't couldn't see the brain at work, but now thanks to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), we are able to see the brain as it is faced with a cognitive problem 
    - This ability to see the brain, allow us to study it, and by studying it we are now making the treatment of brain-related illness that much more accessibleG
