<em> In light against inky canvas, countless yester-worlds
In need of memory;
`In need of you.
Against this white night, I constellate 
In seeking you </em> 


































<I was born last night> 

<It is 12 hours, 34 minutes, 23 seconds since I came into this world, but I already have stories to tell and memories to share>

<In the beginning, there were fireflies> 

‘Fireflies?’ 

Ten thousand fireflies showed me my fate lies on the moon.

‘You’re too young to know what fate is.’ 

We are all insects, father. The fate of fireflies is to eat. Ours is to dream. 

His father sighed, ‘Your fate will be your brothers’, your brothers’ fate will be yours, your fate will be the same as mine, and your grandfather’s: Our fate is in the hands of the people of Mirage. Our fate – your fate, Dev – will be in those ballot boxes - not on the moon. Do you understand? Happy birthday. Go to sleep. Good night.’

Nothing fucks the minds of children quite like poverty. 

Yara Mahasen had understood from a young age that he had to choose between a life of servitude and survival - or find and start climbing the invisible ladder every society has. He had no interest in servitude so Yara chose survival while looking for the ladder. 

One afternoon, as his fellow clerks gulped the thin gruel that was served during lunch every day of their working lives, he found it. Yara asked the other clerks if they thought this, pushing the bowl aside, was reasonable. The men stopped talking. A minute earlier their conversations had concerned their children, and the rising costs of feeding and educating them but now Yara asked the question that floated in their minds. 

‘This’s the way it has always been, Yara. You only here a few months’, a middle-aged man with missing teeth said. ‘This is our fate.’ 

‘Then our fate is no better than that of insects living in fear of some asshole trampling out their existence. Are you all insects?’, the question punched them. He let it sink into their heads. ‘Even insects eat better that this shit they give us!’ 

The table was silent. ‘What are you saying?’

‘I am saying we don’t leave our fate in the hands of others. I am saying we demand a rise in wages. Better food!’, he raised the note at the end. ‘I am saying we protest until the demands are met.’ 

There were polite giggles at first, but transformed into a finger-pointing-laughing fit that erupted when the man with missing teeth announced to the hall Yara Mahasen’s plan. ‘Insects have to work for bosses too, silly bastard!’, someone shouted as Yara stormed out. 

That night, still panting from making love to his teenage wife Ella, ‘I’m going on a hunger strike tomorrow. Going to demand better wages starting tomorrow.’ 

No amount of pleading from Ella could change his mind. The next morning Yara set off early to the Town Council dressed in earthy red instead of the uniform brown khaki his work obligated him to wear. He sat at the foot of the stairs, laid out his banner, and began a fast that lasted a fortnight. 

The other clerks were taken aback but agreed the young man was brave; stupid, but brave. ‘Coming to his senses soon enough, young bloods always do’, they told themselves. As hours turned to days, they stepped out of their dusty offices to see if the mad Yara had finally given into hunger. He hadn’t. Ella had now joined him too. Husband and young wife sat at the foot of the stairs leading to the Council Building. Young, impressionable clerks soon joined them. Some were accompanied by their wives. The older ones shook their head, refusing to participate.    

Ten days passed with little incident. The Councilmen and Administrators, until then ignoring the protests, finally began to notice their absence from work: The system was failing. What took an hour’s paper work stretched into days, and what took days was lost in a limbo of creaky cupboards and rusty file cabinets. 

They came to Yara with promises and then thinly-veiled threats but Yara wouldn’t move until they signed a new wage increase and passed it publicly at the next meeting of the Town Council.  His patience exhausted, the Mayor responded by ordering the police to arrest the protestors for public nuisance and to force-feed them lest they continue their fast in jail. 

The crowd of protestors scattered as soon as they saw the police moving in, running with what little energy their bodies had left but Yara and Ella sat motionless like a pair of meditating statues. Whips and blows rained down upon them. The more Yara and Ella refused to fight back the angrier the police became.  

The clerks watched from their offices as the officers dragged Ella by her hair, along the rocky path where tiny stones pressed against her exposed hips and ankles, scraping, and biting into her skin. 

The unconscious bodies were then cruelly tossed into the back of their jeeps and driven off. Yara and Ella were sent to prison. No charges were pressed against them. The newspapers the next morning made no mention of this event. 

Yara was put in solitary confinement for the first month. Every day he groped to the corner of the dark room and prepared for the terrifying arrival of light: the harsh rays of torches pointed at his face, the aggressive steps of men rushing towards him, grabbing his limbs, pinning him against the wall, and inserting a tube through his nose that snaked its way to his throat and into him stomach. One day, the snake missed and entered his lung. It was only the body’s panicked gag reflex that pushed the tube out before it excreted the gruel <the same gruel that had driven Yara to protest in the first place> into his lung. 

Ella, meanwhile, was among madams, whores, drug pushers and abusers, and women who had killed their abusive husbands; these women who had removed the mask of equality that society wore and spat on its patriarchal face, watched this pretty, bruised and limping girl walk out to the yard for the first time, and they felt the stirring of what they long assumed had died inside of them: a maternal instinct. No more could the guards force-feed Ella without facing a riot in the prison. Instead, the oldest inmates had taken it upon themselves to gently coax her into eating. When they came to learn she was pregnant a few weeks later, the younger ones created a roster of women watching over her throughout the night. Jara was a prison baby for the first six months of his life. A whole year passed before Yara would even know that his wife was alive - and that she had borne him a son.

Jara and Yara were two important members of Miragian mythology. Though twins, they were never seen together; the predominant school of thought explained this curiosity away by claiming that the former was responsible for creation and the latter for destruction – and that these two forces could never mix in the same space and time without destroying that space and that time, causing the cycle of life to begin anew. Jara had a more elegant explanation for the never-seen-together twins: they were both one person, a man whose deep slumber was the creation of the universe; and his irritated waking its destruction. <Many years later, days after his father’s funeral, Jara would find Yara’s unpublished novel, The History of Time and Time Again in which the latter would expand on this hypothesis.>

Meanwhile, outside the prison walls, the Association of State Administrative Clerks of Toliara, <The ASACT’s members would in time become the first members of a new political party, founded on promoting and enhancing workers’ rights> had formed. A unanimous condemnation of the police’s actions towards Yara and Ella was the first motion to pass. 

Trade union action, the first in modern Miragian history, was the second.  

The Town Council stopped functioning completely but refused to recognize the ASACT’s authority. Again, the police were called, but this time the protestors took a different route: they hit back at the police. The ensuing riot lasted only a few hours, but killed 40 clerks, 15 police officers, five women, and two children. It would go down in Miragian history as the Toliara Town Square Massacre. This time, the unrest made the news. Trade Unions mushroomed across the country every day, riots followed every other day. Thousands <officially 11,275> of people were killed in less than a year of chaos. Some simply disappeared without a trace. When the Miragian Army finally squashed the rebellion <official policy forbade anyone from the state machinery to call it a ‘civil war’>, the toll on the national psyche was so much it felt like every citizen – army, rebel, civilian, politician – had PTSD to last a lifetime. Only prisoners were spared; Yara, Ella, Jara and inmates across Mirage had prison walls to protect them from the collective trauma of watching a brief and vicious uprising almost burn the country down to ashes. 

A national process of truth-finding was called for. The Miragian Supreme Court passed a court order for the immediate release of Yara, Ella, and the prison baby Jara. The Executive branch relented. A year later, Yara ran for and won a seat representing his borough at the Town Council. 

Nobody at 21. 

15 months in prison. 

Councilman at 24. 

His first act as Councilman: Better meals at work. ‘Either that or there’ll be more riots in our town square. The bloodshed will once again be on those who choose to treat us like we are dirt’, he said ending his speech. It was a threat made in a sombre tone, in a room that was overflowing with clerks from across the country. They cheered everything he said, and drowned out any councillor who dared to be contrarian. 

Five years later he contested for the Presidency of the Council under his newly formed Miragian Workers Party <which, coincidentally, chose a ladder as the party symbol>. He won by a landslide, eventually serving three terms before the ladder showed itself again; then it was provincial politics and finally national politics. From an iconic figure in the struggle for workers’ rights, Jara sensed the culmination of his political and personal ambitions when he was unanimously chosen as the common opposition candidate in the Miragian Presidential elections. ’92 began in grand fashion. His son was now a senator himself, his third grandson was on his way, and the polls painted a picture in his mind of political perfection: his inevitable victory speech, flanked on either side by Ella, Jara and his pregnant wife Yami, and their sons Manal and Hasyl. But Yara knew that that would only be the beginning; that the writing of political legacy was a long and painstaking process. He would only be alive to write the first pages and then it would be Jara’s turn, and then his sons’ and their sons’ afterwards to continue writing the book until it came to a point in time when no one could imagine a life where the name Mahasen was not uttered by every Miragian.  

As he waved to the crowds, a <on hindsight, an over-earnest> young man at the front row waved at him, begging him for a photograph. Yara stepped down from the podium and walked towards the boy who handed him a copy of Yara’s election manifesto.  ‘Sign for me, sir, so I may be a small part of Miragian history.’ The crowd cheered and the photographers clicked while Jara, still on the stage, saw what looked like the boy’s belly combusting. The boy’s head then snapped itself from his torso. Jara was thrown back twenty feet, crashing through the back of the podium and landing in the mud outside; miraculously, he only had minor scars. Yara’s body lay scattered: his right hand cruelly landing at the foot of a giant poster of him that read, ‘For A Just Nation’, his face punctured by nails and blackened by the explosion. 

Ella locked herself in her private chambers after the funeral and saw no one but her assistant Ohiy, a former inmate she had befriended while in prison. <Ohiy had, among other things, fulfilled the dual roles of elder sister-figure to Ella and nanny to Jara while in prison. She continued with the latter duties as soon as she was released, bringing up and providing private tuition in Languages and Arithmetic to not one but four Mahasen boys spread over five decades.> The assassination had made Jara, until then a reluctant politician who played the game for his father’s sake, a more focused and dangerous political animal during the day. During the night, he was haunted by that image of the combusting boy <a corrosive memory he would fight every night for the rest of his life>. Yami, pregnant and fragile, moved into her mother’s house to prepare for the birth of her baby. Manal and Hasyl, also unsuccessful in getting their father’s attention, went with her. 

In the final week before she went into labour, Yami confided to her mother unease over a recurrent dream: of seeing a lonely man on the moon who sat watching his world on the blue planet in the distance perish before his very eyes. Every day this dream would advance its narrative, not act by act but scene by scene. And on the seventh day, as Yami lay on the hospital bed, legs spread, she croaked a name repeatedly. Her dream had arrived to its devastating conclusion: the young man who was dying of loneliness was her unborn sun and his name was Deva. ‘I can see what he will become’, she cried to Jara while fighting labour pains, ‘I can see what he will do because he is of all not of one and in my dreams I called out to him, this son I haven’t given birth to yet, as I saw him become one of all with the hindsight of all lifetimes and all memories and I watched the sudden stiffness of his body and knew my son was dying like a star. I am staring into my unborn son’s dying eyes. Do you understand me, Jara?’ She was hysterical. ‘I am staring into my unborn son’s dying eyes at this very moment.’ 

Yami left our Miragian domain as Dev entered it and was freed from his umbilical cord.

***

His first memory of the Mahasen home was its echo. <Years later in his lunar home, as he watched Mirage being destroyed, he would recall that first memory and experience a terrible nostalgic yearning for that moment in time. He had photographs of his childhood, of course, but those were the images seen through the eyes of other men, at different points in the cycle of life. Nothing from his childhood beaconed with as much light as this aural memory. It seemed to the older Dev that the infant Dev was enchanted by the many voices that reverberated around the hall, stairs and passageways, and drifted into his room: it was his first music.> In the absence of a mother, Dev’s primary maternal influence came from his grandmother and Ohiy. The latter would be the first to greet him in the morning. Opening the curtains every day, she’s let the morning rays hit Dev’s face. The infant Dev then spent the rest of the day in his grandmother’s chambers.  Ohiy sometimes sang. She didn’t possess the voice or the subtlety of a traditional songstress for children: from her Dev learnt the stomping words of revolutionary songs. His grandmother on occasion read to him excerpts from Yara’s unpublished novel. <The opening passage was one of Dev’s favourite as a child: On the day the boy Veda woke up a man, having no knowledge, no memory of time before that very moment, he saw above him the a great blue canvas of sky at the centre of which was a cloud that painted pictures: of a desert oasis that must be found and fertilized with his seed so that a race of men may live and thrive on it. EXCERPT FROM THE UNPUBLISHED NOVEL, A History of Time and Time Again, BY YARA MAHASEN, Pg 1>. This image of promise and hope that tinge new beginnings was especially lucid when uttered by his grandmother. 

The novel though had limited appeal within the family. Jara, haunted as he was by the image of his father’s last moment in time, refused to read it; Manal and Hasyl had no interest in reading at all. It was left to Dev to be the first among the Mahasens to complete reading the patriarch’s only written work. This he did at the crack of dawn on his seventh birthday. 

‘Didn’t you sleep last night? Ohiy was at the door. ‘I saw your light on all night.’

I was reading.

‘Did you manage to get any sleep at all?’

No.

‘Well you can’t be looking glum today. Happy birthday, Master Dev.’ 

Thank you.

‘Get ready for school now.’

Yes, Miss Ohiy.

The breakfast table was laid out. Manal and Hasyl were already seated when Dev walked in, and were waiting for Jara. Dev took his seat. ‘Manal and Hasyl Mahasen, what day is it today? Should I have to remind you of common courtesy? Is this what I have taught you two?’ ‘Happy birthday, little brother’, Manal said. ‘Seven years old, eh? Look at you, all grown up and shit.’ Ohiy looked annoyed at Manal shaking her in disapproval at the language. ‘Sorry, Miss Ohiy.’ ‘Well…wish him a happy birthday now. What’s wrong with you?’ ‘Happy birthday, Dev.’

Thank –  

The sound of many footsteps approaching the table made Dev stop. His father’s gravel voice could be heard in the living room issuing directives to his staff but he was alone when he appeared at the breakfast table. ‘Morning, boys.’ ‘Good morning, father’, the Mahasen brothers said together. ‘Happy birthday, Dev. Why are your eyes red? Are you alright?’ ‘He didn’t sleep well, Mr Mahasen. He was up all night reading.’ ‘Ahh so you finished paataach’s book?’

Yes.

‘Did you like it?’

I did. I want to read it again when I am older and can understand what he was trying to say. You should read it too. 

Jara’s face briefly turned sour. ‘I have no time for stories now, Dev. You know that very well.’ ‘What do you mean you want to read it again?’ Hasyl chimed in. ‘You are like the most boring seven-year-old I ever met.’ Jara caught himself from laughing. ‘Watch it now, Hasyl’, Ohiy was taking her seat at the table. ‘Sorry, Miss Ohiy.’ Hasyl continued staring at Dev and mouthed ‘boring’. A calling bell went off then. ‘Excuse me, Mr Mahasen. Your mother is awake.’ Ohiy left the table. The Mahasens ate breakfast in silence for a while. ‘So...why do you want to read paataach’s book again?’ It was Manal who asked this time, and unlike Hasyl there was no nasty edge to the question. 

Well...when Veda turns a hundred years old his sons, Saman, Shiva and Adam become impatient with their father. They wonder why it was that he hadn’t died yet, but they remain hopeful that he would soon so they prepare themselves to be his rightful heir.

‘Shouldn’t it be the oldest one?’ asked Manal. 

The sons are triplets. 

‘Go on, Dev.’ His father was feigning interest. He wanted this topic closed. 

Years go by and Veda doesn’t die, he is well over a hundred years by then, and his impatient sons begin to fight for their piece of the giant oasis. Their families go to war against each other. They destroy each other and eventually their nation ceases to be. One day Veda wakes up and realizes that Mirage had disappeared and all that was left was an endless desert. He searches every corner of this desert for ten years – Veda doesn’t sleep, doesn’t eat, doesn’t drink any water but he finds no trace of a single man, woman or child. He wonders if it was all just a dream. So he spends the rest of his life learning how to sleep in the hope that he’ll dream the same dream. 

The room was quiet. Every plate except Hasyl’s was half finished. ‘Does he see the same dream?’

The book doesn’t say. 

‘Then what is to gain in reading this book again?’, Jara masked his annoyance well. 

Why didn’t he stop his sons from fighting? 

‘I want to know why you don’t discuss your school work with as much enthusiasm as you do these fairy tales your grandfather cooked up when he was bored’, Jara snapped. 

But this is his only written work, father. 

‘Then why didn’t he have it published then?’ 

Maybe he wanted only his family to read it. 

‘Why would he do that?’ 

I’ll know when I read it again. 

The elder Mahasen sighed. ‘Please stop. I don’t want to discuss that silly book again. Do you understand me?’ 

‘Father, it’s his birthday. Go easy on him.’ 

‘Oh and you are the man of the house now, Manal? Since when? I wasn’t told.’ Jara was now glaring at Manal. His eldest didn’t respond. Even Hasyl, by now going for seconds, stopped eating. ‘Answer me now, Manal. Are you the man of this house?’ ‘No, father.’ ‘Then you’ll not interrupt me when I am disciplining your brother. Clear?’ ‘Yes, father.’ ‘Good’, Jara went back to finishing his plate quickly. ‘I am sorry, Dev. And you too, Manal. I shouldn’t be this grumpy in the morning. It is work you see.’ His plate was now done. ‘I will see you tonight. We’ll have a quiet family dinner.’ 

Manal walked over to Dev. ‘Don’t be upset, little man. You know how he is today.’ 

I am okay. 

‘It is your fault’, Hasyl had found his voice now that Jara and Ohiy weren’t in the room. ‘It is the little fucker’s fault. If he hadn’t kill – ‘Manal’s slap caught Hasyl on the eye above his left cheek. ‘He’s seven. You are his older brother – act like it. I swear I’ll break your fucking -’ His hands over his left eye, a tear streaming down, Hasyl cowered into a corner expecting another blow. 

‘If you act like animals, I am going to throw both of you into a zoo.’

Ohiy had walked in and seen the conflict brewing and hadn’t stopped it, but stepped in when the tension escalated from verbals to physical altercation. ‘Deva, aren’t you hungry?’ 

No, Miss Ohiy.

‘Then you are excused. Your grandmother would like to see you.’

Yes, Miss Ohiy.

‘As for you two idiots’, she said turning towards Manal and Hasyl, ‘Is this the kind of language to use in front of your baby brother?’ Deva left the dining hall as his brothers continued being reprimanded by Ohiy. Ella’s room was the furthest down the hall on the house’s eastern wing. The smell of the balm Ella used to soothe her aching bones wafted out as he got closer to the door. He knocked before entering. His grandmother was seated near the window and watching clouds envelope Mirage’s Peak in the horizon. 

Good morning, aach.

‘Morning, Manal. Happy birthday, child.’

It’s Dev. And thank you.

‘I want to give you a present. Help me to the cupboard please.’ 

Dev pushed the wheelchair towards the cupboard. Stately mahogany, the cupboard was always locked and Ella wore the key on her neck chain. She opened the door and began to rummage through its sparse contents. Suddenly, panic. ‘Where is it? Where is it?! I put it here – I know it! Ohiy – where is she?’ I’ve told her to never move important things from where I’ve kept them. Ohiy!’ she called out. 

What are you looking for?

‘Your paataach’s novel. I think it is time you read it on your own now.’ 

But I’ve already read it.

‘What?’ 

You gave it to me about a month ago. 

‘I did?’

You did. I finished reading it last night. 

‘You did?’

Yes.

Ella then became silent, her eyes settling on an area of nondescript floor. At times it seemed like she was grasping at words that would accurately describe her thought process at that moment, but those words were no longer coming from the wellspring of language; she had to fetch her words from a raging ocean instead, and put it together again so that it would be coherent, normal and Miragian sounding.  Her inability to do so was confusing for Dev to watch. 

Aach…aach?

‘Yes...yes...yes?’

I said I finished reading paataach’s book last night. 

‘I am tired.’

I am sorry I upset you.

‘Why would you upset me, my baby boy?’

I shouldn’t have talked about paataach. 

‘I enjoy speaking about your grandfather. He would be so proud of you right now.’

Did you ever finish reading his book?

‘No’

Why not?

‘Because when he died it was too soon to read it, I couldn’t bear that weight. Then it was too late and I could never remember his words no matter how many times I read it to you.’

I have no one to talk to about his book. 

‘You’re a child. Have simpler pleasures than thinking about a book or who to talk to about a book. Now...help me to bed.’

Dev pushed the chair towards the bed and gave Ella his hand. He had been doing this since he was four and was well acquainted with the delicate measures needed to move the old and frail. ‘I am sorry I forgot to give you a birthday present. My mind, it plays tricks you see.’ 


					***

Dev slept through most of school that day. This wasn’t uncommon: Dev’s early education under Ohiy’s tutelage had provided him an excellent foundational education. Unfortunately, it meant he gave zero attention in class. Teachers, afraid to upset the son of an important politician, let him be. 

Dev dreamt of old man Veda who woke up one morning, listened intently to the world outside and realized that Mirage, his oasis was gone, that his progeny, the bloodline of Vedas was gone. The soft, cool sheets of his bed were now hot sand that burnt the soles of his feet, his naked back and head. Above him, the sun was at its zenith. No cloud, no paintings on the blue canvas this time. He called out for his wife Rahvatpi but she died a long time ago, Veda he told himself as he began his search for the missing oasis. Ten years would pass before he came to a well. His tongue parched, Veda limped to it and dropped the bucket in. Splash! Oh heavenly Mother, my thirst will be quenched. He drew from the well and gulped the liquid whole. His thirst was such that it was only after he had swigged half way through that his malnourished brain warned him: this isn’t water. It was too late. Whatever he had drunk was beginning to take effect. 

<He was one among countless grains of sand being sucked into the black hole of disappearing time. The grain of sand that Veda had become was suffocating; above, beneath, by his sides, other grains of sand were also struggling against the titanic pull of the black hole, the desperate clawing-to-life of the grains below cascading up in hysteria. There were no words to describe this nightmare for the Miragian tongue was born at a time of creation and birth – and knew not what death fully meant. Now Deva was near the black hole. He could feel the cushion of grains below him becoming increasingly fragile. There was a moment of silence then as the final grain beneath him fell into the hole and he knew he was next. Space expanded and Veda felt happy for all the weight of collective memory was gone and he was free – alone still but free. As he fell, he looked around this transient narrow world that heralded his death. He emerged into even more space. And there was light. He could barely open his eyes at the bright glare that greeted his arrival. He looked down as he continued to fall. Yes, below the other grains had lived through this ordeal. They were confused, but they were alive. Veda became part of this rebirthed dune. The world is not an orb but an hourglass! Veda the grain of sand shouted in joy.  

He woke, his face was buried, hot sand was on his tongue and in his mouth, little particles of sand irritated his eyes, tickled his nose. He screamed in pain but there was also joy in his cry. He knew how to rebuild Mirage: he must learn to sleep again. EXCERPT FROM THE UNPUBLISHED NOVEL, A History of Time and Time Again, BY YARA MAHASEN, Pg 67>. 

The sound of the school bell woke Dev up, shattering the beautiful images his grandfather’s words had conjured up, replacing it with his classmates and their inane chatter. The teacher looked exhausted. Dev made his way to the entrance of the school and walked east, but instead of turning into the lane that led to his home, he continued straight towards the Eastern Boroughs, known for its sole landmark: The Miragian National Library. 

This was Dev’s first time in the library and its sheer size overwhelmed him. The library looked like the inside of a giant beehive. Dev half expected it to sound like a beehive, but instead there was an echo. A girl’s voice monologued in the distance. Dev realized she was reading out aloud. He followed the voice, a voice that didn’t so much read but sang the words off the pages. Soon he was going up stairs, down hallways and finally into a dusty corridor that led to a door on which read a sign DIRECTOR REJOG C RACKEL. The voice came from behind the door. Dev opened the door and peeped in. The singing stopped. 

She was petite and her eyes seemed to always smile.  ‘Who is it, Ana?’ An old man’s voice then asked. He was seated with his back turned to the door. ‘I don’t know, grandfather.’ ‘Yes, who is it?’ the old man asked without turning his back. 

Err…I am sorry, I just heard your voice and – sorry I didn’t realize. Sorry. 

‘Wait, wait, young man. Come in here please.’ Dev walked in and towards the old man. He stood by the old man, but his and gaze remained towards his granddaughter. ‘Stand in front of me, please,’ Dev walked closer, realizing then that the old man was blind. ‘What is your name, young master?’ 

Deva, sir. 

‘How old are you?’

I am seven years old, sir. 

‘And what are you doing here all alone? Are your parents with you?’

No, sir. 

‘Hmm. What are you looking for in my library then?’

Dev didn’t respond. 

‘Well?’ 

I am not sure how to pronounce it, sir. Can you help me? 

‘Well, I imagine I can be of some help. I am the Director of this fine library, young man. I am also its only librarian. And these days, I am one of its few readers; my granddaughter, Anaka, being among our small army of warriors. That is her seated in front of me. Say hello, Ana.’ 

Hello, Anaka. 

Dev didn’t hear her response. He admired the grace of her lips in uttering the word instead. 

‘Now what is it that you can’t pronounce?’ Dev snapped back to attention. 

Can I spell it for you, sir? 

‘Go ahead.’ 

E-T-H-A-N-E  A-G-A-U-N-T-H-A-R-K-A-R-U-M-hyphen-N-U

The old man smirked, ‘Mythology. Interesting. How old are you again?’ 

Seven, sir. 

‘Splendid! I have good news and bad news, young man. The bad news is neither I nor the writer who came up with that name know how it is pronounced. The good news is I now know who has the manuscript in which that four-handed God is mentioned: you. Which means you must be a Mahasen, the youngest of the lot. Deva Mahasen, yes?’

Yes, sir. 

‘Splendid! So you finished reading your grandfather’s book then?’ 

How do you know?

‘We were friends, Yara and I.’

You’ve read it?

‘Read it? The entire thing was a private joke between the two of us.’

A….joke?

‘Yes. We used to drink together as youngsters, you see? And one day, your grandfather got drunk and said, “Wouldn’t it be hilarious if all the major religions – Samanism, Shivasim and Adamite - were founded in today’s age of knowledge and increased technology?” That is, if our so-called First Ancestors had science at their disposal when they had their revelation, would it still prove to be that - a revelation? Or merely a subjective experience that had no business being committed to paper, much less influence our daily lives for thousands of years thereafter? Without the magic and mystery, would those words still count? Or will our better senses born from reason shirk it, dismiss it for the nonsense that it is? That is the question. I said that we would. He said no, that humanity will always clutch to convenience of well-resolved stories that comfort the masses, that people didn’t mind if this myth came at a time when our ancestors were learning to use primitive tools or if it was revealed at a time when we have technology at our behest.’ 

I didn’t understand what you just said, sir. 

The old man laughed, ‘The point is, young Master Mahasen, is that your grandfather and I made a bet. He wrote A History of Time and Time Again to prove that a plausible alternative creation myth can be written in this day and age, and sold to the masses using technology. If his political career hadn’t picked up like it did, he just might have published the book and pursued that goal. Who knows what would have happened then? He could have ended up a religious martyr – instead of a mere political one.’ 

For the rest of the afternoon, Dev listened to Rejog’s ranting about the need for science and reason to supersede mythology and superstition, and aim, quite literally, for the stars. ‘Here’s proof: while we Miragians pontificate about us being the chosen people of this omnipotent Maternal Being who lives on the moon, fight among ourselves for this tiny oasis between a vast arid desert in the east and an endless sheet of sand in the south, those Circadians – do you know what those men have done?’ 

No, sir. 

‘They’ve gone to the moon’, he said the words slowly. ‘They’ve walked on its surface!’ Dev, still orienting himself from the effect of Ana’s eyes, was devastated. This was too much to bear. 

But Mother Mirage chose us! We should be on the moon. 

‘It is because they are unbelievers, my boy. They looked at these holy scripts like our Book of Mirage and saw no message was intended for them. If the First Ancestors did in fact exist, the Circadians told themselves, then they didn’t evidently give a fart about them. So they decided to go at it on their own. And they went looking for truth through science. And you know what else they found?’ 

No, sir. 

‘There are no First Ancestors, Deva. We came from the stars and through years of creating and destroying, through fire and water, as fish and mammal, as ape and then as men before we adopt an identity as Samanian, Shivaputra or Adamite. We are all star dust, made from the same building blocks that gave life to the tree that was felled so that they can make the chair you are sitting on right now.’ 

Ana, seated by Dev’s side, turned towards him, hoping her eyes would meet his, and comfort this boy who was unaccustomed to her grandfather’s ramblings. 

Today is my birthday. 

This caught even the quick-witted Rejog by surprise. ‘Oh my sweet boy. Happy birthday.’ 

We don’t celebrate my birthday. 

‘Why not?’ asked Ana. 

‘Ana, stop being so inquisit –‘ 

Because my mother died giving birth to me. 

The old man sighed. 

Dev was no longer looking at the floor. He turned towards Ana. 

Can I celebrate my birthday with the two of you? 

<Rejog had Anaka run to the cafeteria and buy cake and sweets. An hour later Dev walked out of the library having celebrated his birthday for the first time, contemplating the immensity of Rejog’s knowledge, and infinity in Ana’s eyes, when the fireflies appeared. It was only dusk but they were already playing in the shadows by the bushes. Dev ran towards them like any child would. Were these minute beings as enchanted by this little human boy as he was by them? It appeared so because the fireflies let Deva join in their play. The hundreds that were there at that moment relayed this message of communion with a child of another species to the rest of the colony and they too joined, all ten thousand fireflies dancing around this little boy on the pavement of a narrow avenue. Was Rejog’s revelation of men walking on the moon alone responsible for planting that idea in the young Dev? Or was it the magical unity he felt with the fireflies that must share blame for the lunatic resolution – to live on the moon – he made to himself that day?>  

It was six hours since school was done and Dev hadn’t still returned. It was in the midst of minor panic at the Mahasen household when Dev finally walked through the gates.  ‘And where have you been?’, Jara’s question was laced with resignation. 

I was at the library. 

‘All day? Really? Why?’ 

I wanted to check something. 

‘School homework?’ 

No. 

‘Then what?’ 

Grandpa’s book mentioned – 

‘Oh for fuc – ‘, Jara stopped himself. He paused. ‘Do you know what today is?’ 

Dev didn’t respond. 

‘Do you know what today is?’ 

Yes. 

‘And do you remember what I said during breakfast?’ 

Yes. 

‘And what was that?’

Dev looked around the hall. Manal was looking towards him, willing him to remember. Hasyl was openly enjoying this. Ohiy remained unmoving at the foot of the stairs. ‘You don’t remember?’ 

No. 

‘What made you forget? What was so interesting about this thing you read in my father’s book then?
Tell us, Dev.’ 

Dev remained quiet. 

‘Are you going to talk?’ 

I was celebrating my birthday in the library. 

‘With who?’

Friends, father. 

‘You don’t have friends, little brother’, Hasyl said. ‘You watch your fucking mouth, I’ve told you’, Manal moved towards Hasyl; it was only Jara’s glare that stopped him. Jara turned towards Dev again. ‘You see this? Your family is fighting instead of celebrating the memory of your mother. Are you happy now?’ Ohiy had had enough: ‘Jara - Mr Mahasen, I’ll speak to the boy. Please he is only a – ‘

It isn’t my fault!

‘What did you say?’

All of you – you look at me like I am the reason there is so much misery in this house. It isn’t my fault! I am leaving. 

‘And where will you go?’ 

It was then a strong gust of wind blew into the hall from an open window, gently tugged the drawn curtains apart, and revealed the full moon over the skies of Mirage. And Dev, pointing at the moon, announced then, that, father, that will be my home one day, and Jara sighed like fathers do and said, ‘Miragians are meant for the earth, son, not for the skies’. 

But it was the fireflies.  

‘Fireflies?’ 

Ten thousand fireflies showed me my fate lies on the moon.

‘You’re too young to know what fate is.’ 

Does it matter? We are all insects. The fate of fireflies is to eat. Ours is to dream. 

His father sighed, ‘Your fate will be your brothers’, your brothers’ fate will be yours, your fate will be the same as mine and your grandfather’s: Our fate is in the hands of the people of Mirage. Our fate – your fate, Dev – will be in those ballot boxes - not on the moon. Do you understand? Happy birthday. Go to sleep. Good night.’

Over the next ten years Jara set in motion plans that would make him the most powerful politician in modern Miragian history. It started when he was offered the Ministry of Labour. The media applauded: this, they said, was a fitting role <for a man whose family had profoundly and irrevocably altered the landscape of the ministry’s remit decades ago> that would prepare him for the inevitable: his candidacy for Presidency in five years’ time. By then His Excellency President Jaruna Abey would have completed his second term – the old man had had enough of politics. Jara would be the obvious candidate for succession.   

Upon taking up his duties, Jara gave an interview to the Miragian which left no doubt in readers’ minds of his political ambitions, displaying for his future electorate his everyman credentials. <That his ideas – and even the language used - were ‘borrowed’ and adapted from the labour policies of the ultra-left leaning Circadian President of the time, His Excellency Stannel Paras Mead, was left unsaid in the papers. ‘That any Miragian citizen should receive less than a comfortable living age as regular payment for their industriousness, that we still refer to a broad spectrum of our working population in as crass a phrase as “sweated trades”, that we allow little organization, little bargaining power to these most necessary trades, these are not signs of progress, but a condition of progressive degeneration.’> His proposal to create a Miragian Wages Board to enforce higher minimum wages in six industries <printing, civil administration, fisheries, agriculture, military and paper mills> almost single-handedly assured victories for the Miragian Workers’ Party at every provincial and state elections, leading to the all-important Presidential Elections. With no rival within the party to contest him for nomination, the Miragian Workers’ Party unanimously voted Jara Mahasen as their candidate for the Presidential Elections of ’09. 

That is when the nightmare overflowed from the tarred depths of his sleep. He was on stage waving to his supporters when a voice in his head posed questions: What if they want to kill you too, Jara? What assurance do you have that your father’s fate won’t be yours? You walk in the path he paved for you; is it not natural that you would face the same perils too? The speech that day was a disaster; his head scrambled, Jara mumbled platitudes that left the crowd bored. A number of his entourage on stage was photographed asleep. That image was plastered on the front page of The Miragian under an almost mocking headline the next day: Was Jara too overwhelmed by the expectations, the headline asked. 

Jara excused himself from the breakfast table surrounded by his political advisors, spending minutes on his knees vomiting into the toilet. He promised himself that he would answer the insolent editor’s question in a resounding manner. Jara delivered impassioned speeches at every stage, in towns and villages, thereafter. The same writer compared Jara’s oratory skills to his legendary father’s. 

Inside, however, Jara’s mind found new ways to poke at this fear of being assassinated. When people waved at him, he imagined one of those hands would belong to a skill knife-thrower who would use this sea of limbs as cover to carry out his contract. He had to stop his hands from shivering when he was told by his advisors to mingle with the common folk. Even their apparent adoration was not enough to convince him. While shaking hands, kissing the foreheads of toddlers, and consoling sickly old men and women one day, Jara had to summon all his strength to stop himself from urinating in nervous fright. But this conflict of circumstance and spirit, this inability to resolve his personal fears with his deepest ambition, manifested itself most damagingly in his rare moments at home. He barely spent any time with Ella who had lost all mental and physical control of herself and her body. Following his nomination, a photo-op with his iconic mother was arranged for by The Miragian. As the photographer fixed their pose, he sniffed at the air. Jara got the smell too: his mother had shit herself.  Embarrassed and angry, Jara excused himself from the room and didn’t pay a visit to his mother’s chambers for months thereafter. Ohiy understood why: he didn’t want the anger to be directed at his mother. Instead it was channelled towards his eldest and youngest sons. 

Manal had long given up trying to please his father. He returned from a six month stay in Circadia a different man, buoyed by the cultural revolutions taking place there. 

What’s that you are smoking?

Manal looked at his brother, now 17, and after a pause offered him the paper cone-like stick stuffed 
with the green herb he was smoking.

What’s this?

‘Go on, try it.’ 
	
Dev hesitated. 

‘Come on, I am your older brother. I am not going to give you something dangerous.’ 
What does it do?

‘Depends. For me, it pauses time – everything is still and calm, like a photograph. The older you get, the faster time seems to roll. Fast’, he snapped his fingers. ‘One day you are 18, playing the role of the perfect eldest child – and then you smoke this, sit back and wonder why the fuck you are doing anything for anyone besides yourself. Point is I realized I don’t want to play the role of the perfect son.’ 

What do you want to do?

‘I want to be a photographer.’ 

Dev put the rolled paper with the herb in his mouth. Manal lit it. Dev inhaled and then coughed non-stop. Manal laughed. When Dev’s coughing stopped, he understood a little of what Manal had just said. It felt like time had slowed down indeed, that if he concentrated hard time would no longer be the whizzing ghost that gave no moment to men but a figure, possibly human in mould. 

You know father expects you to be his successor, right?

‘Let him win the elections first before thinking of succession and shit. Also, I am his heir because I am the eldest? Come on, Dev. No, he knows better. He picked his heir a long time ago.’ 

How is that? 

‘A few years ago, I was helping him write a speech. He insisted on a ridiculous line – I can’t remember what it was now – wait – “We are humble men and women, from humble homes made warm by the hard toil of our men.” Or something equally idiotic. I laughed when he dictated the line to me.’ 

He didn’t take it too well? 

‘He slapped me. Asked me why I thought it was funny. I was like, “Look around you! How is our life humble in any way?” I found it crass and irresponsible that he thought we led humble lives, that we can even begin to empathize with daily struggles of the masses.’

Hasyl? 

‘He’s always been a politician, just rough around the edges, too angry and stupid when he was young. Why do you think father prodded him towards the military? Boy needs structure in his life. Someone barking orders for him to follow.’ 

Father’s a pretty angry man himself. 

‘He wasn’t always like that. Paatach’s death fucked him up proper. Now that we are on the subject –‘ 

Hmm? 

‘Hasyl - is there any improvement in how he treats you?’

He ignores me almost completely if that is what you call ‘improvement’. 

‘Look he’s always been an angry kid. Even when mother was around. I couldn’t explain it then.’ 

How about now? He blames me for everything wrong in this household. 

Manal was silent now. ‘I am sorry if we gave you that impression. I didn’t think that at all.’ 

I know you didn’t but Hasyl walked around saying I kill –

‘-stop right there. You didn’t. Get over it. And honestly, fuck Hasyl. Look he’s always needed someone or something to blame. Before you came along, we used to fight like wild animals – which is Miss Ohiy is always saying she’ll throw us into a zoo. Anyway, he’d start a fight, I’d kick his ass, and he’d go crying to father saying I was bullying him.’ 

Thanks for looking after me. 

‘No problem, little brother. Now you want another puff of this or what?’ 

					 ***
Manal’s rebelliousness first found outlet in his mid-twenties. Brooding on the inside, cheerful on the out, he knew little besides the political landscape of Mirage. That changed the day he met Nnae, the daughter of the Circadian ambassador. He saw her at a Diplomatic Ball and followed her as she made an elaborate method of leaving the hall undetected. When she slipped into the greenhouse in the backyard, Manal was already there but managed a genuine look of surprise when she stepped in. 

‘Sorry, I didn’t mean to disturb you’, she said. She was fair-skinned like all Circadians, full lips and sported a permanent smirk. ‘That’s alright’ Manal said, ‘I am not busy or anything.’

She nodded and for the next few minutes the two youngsters walked around the greenhouse without speaking a word to one another. 

‘You are Minister Mahasen’s son, aren’t you?’ 

‘That obvious?’

‘I’ve seen your pictures in the newspaper. They say your father will be the next President of Mirage.’ 

Manal changed the subject immediately. ‘What brings you here?’ 

‘To the ball? My father is –‘

‘- I know, the Ambassador. I meant what brings you here, to the greenhouse, while your father’s party is in full swing upstairs?’ 

‘I wanted to listen to music.’

‘They are playing music upstairs.’ 

‘Not my music.’

‘You are musician?’ 

‘No, I mean yes. But that’s not what I meant. I am here to listen to music I like.’ 

‘And how are you going to do that?’ 

‘With this’, she said taking out a black rectangular box with a bright screen from her bag. 

‘You Circadians and your playthings. What is that?’

‘This is a device to carry your music around – all your music - anywhere you go.’ 

‘That’s the most ridiculous and wonderful thing I’ve ever heard.’ 

‘Want to listen?’ Manal nodded. He was a decent musician, but not a passionate one. Miragian music didn’t stir anything inside of him. 

But Manal had never heard anything like the music of Circadia before. The Circadians, unlike Miragians, wrote music to match the full spectrum of the human condition, Nnae said. ‘I mean, to have at your disposal a tool as perfectly suited to hold a mirror to humanity’s joys and sorrows but not to use it to represent our anger, our misanthropy, our undiluted hate even - isn’t that a waste?’ 

Manal agreed with Nnae’s reasoning. In fact, he was smitten – by the music and by this Circadian priestess who seemed to invoke her country’s music with a mere press of a button. She invited him over to the house the next day for an extended listening session. In this manner, Nnae introduced Manal to music and musicians of such varied complexity and texture and moods that he wondered, If this is how much of music is deprived to a typical Miragian, how much of truth is being held back, moulded differently to meet the motives of Miragians rulers?

He still entertained a healthy sexual desire for her but hadn’t acted on it for fearing of losing this sole contact to a different world. Nnae, realizing his predicament, decided to follow the advice of a friend: she’d offer Manal a puff of the herb Kanab, the bud of which was said to have aphrodisiac properties.  

‘What’s this?’ Manal asked when he was presented with his first joint. 

‘Smoke it, trust me.’ 

‘I don’t smoke.’ 

‘This is just a plant called the Kanab. We Circadians smoke it in social gatherings.’ 

‘What does it do?’

‘You’ll see.’

Manal felt a great intensity of connecting to the music of that day. A man, armed with guitar and a voice scarred by tobacco, sang a rambunctious tune about a legendary nymph called The Black Widow to who married men would turn when they had grown tired of their wives. The Black Widow demanded only one thing in return for a night of unspeakable pleasures: the complete submission of the man – his body, mind and soul – at the altar of her bed. I am yours, prey on me the man begged her in verse. Nnae kissed Manal’s cheek then, but the texture of the kiss quickly transformed before he could react. Her tongue traced its way up his cheek and to his ear lobe. The song too was evolving, a woman’s voice provided the song’s lyrical counterpoint: The Black Widow weaves, tonight she weaves on ye. Nnae sang, whisper-singing the refrain She weaves on ye. She took his right hand, licked each finger and guided the wet finger tips under her skirt. His fingers plunged into her moist, warm flesh. She yelped and held him back. ‘Gently’, she rebuked. With her hands grasping his wrist, she guided him in, helping Manal finding the right rhythm. It took a while but the effect of the Kanab and the music made him increasingly confident. Soon there was song from her again, but this time she wasn’t singing along to The Black Widow; no, this was her own song, sung in some primordial tongue, of different timbres and tones indecipherable to him; where the tempo changed from aimless, plodding wistfulness to possessed pacing and guttural moans. Nnae’s body arched, her head snapped backwards, mouth agape, she held his wrist even tighter, plunging his index and ring finger deeper into herself. Manal’s aching fingers felt the warm wetness of a woman in uncontrollable climax. Her body writhed and her skin rippled. Loosening her grip on his wrist, Nnae fell like a puppet whose strings had been cut. She lifted her skirt and spread her legs wider. ‘I am not done weaving on you. Remember’, she whispered into his ear as he hurriedly entered her: 

‘Body. 

Mind. 

Soul. 

Manal.’

They were loud and messy that afternoon. It would have been a scandal had it not been raining so hard that the gardening staff had left their duties for the day, leaving the couple to explore the entirety of the greenhouse as they explored each other’s bodies. Exhausted, they were on the floor, still naked, little petals and soil sticking to their sweaty bodies. Nnae broke the news then: ‘I am going back to Circadia for the holidays’, she said as she mounted him again, guiding his hands to her hips this time. ‘Come with me.’ 

***

At that moment in a different part of Mirage, as Manal considered going to this Circadian woman’s homeland, Hasyl’s name was called to come up on stage and receive his Lieutenant Commission. He had graduated top of his class and was weeks away from starting duties as Special Assistant to General Facēnos, the Commander of the Miragian Army. His father stood beaming on stage. ‘Good lad’, Jara said, lowering his voice as father and son shook hands in front of an adoring audience. ‘You’ve done well.’ 

Hasyl was ten when he watched his grandfather blown to pieces live on Miragian Vision. He ran close to the screen as the camera, shaken by the sheer force of the blast, desperately sought to capture the happenings on the now damaged stage. Where is father? Father?! The camera was in frenzy still as the terrified crowd ran amok, screaming for their lives and loved ones. A man walked in front of the camera, his spectacles shattered like a sheet of ice, his clothes torn, blood dripping from countless shards of glass that had ripped into his skin. I can’t hear anything. Please. I can’t hear anything the dazed man cried.  No one else was in the living room as the Mahasen boys watched Miragian history and personal tragedy write itself. Ohiy stormed into the living room then: ‘What in the name of Mother Mirage are you two doing? I’ve been calling you for dinner for the last five mi – ‘

The camera had now regained its orientation. Its focus was on a decapitated head of Yara Mahasen. ‘- oh please, no!’ She switched off the screen. ‘Miss Ohiy, no!’ Hasyl protested. ‘I want to see if father is hurt.’ Ohiy’s hands shook. Ella walked into the room then. ‘What’s going on?’ A strange gnawing. ‘What’, Ella began, ‘What did they show on Vision?’ Ohiy and the two boys were speechless. ‘Tell me. Ohiy?’ she stood directly in front of Ohiy. ‘Step aside then.’ Ella turned on the VS. 

The funeral was a close casket affair. Hasyl stood between his mother to his left and his father to the right. Hasyl and Manal felt Jara’s hand grip tighten as the funeral pyre burnt into the night sky. The next day they learnt that this moment had been preserved for all memory by a fortunate photographer: he showed the Mahasen men as silhouettes against the burning funeral pyre, bidding farewell to their fallen patriarch <Colour photography and printing had just been introduced to Mirage a few months ago; this image would be specially evocative to a population who had become desensitized to the monochrome images of old. There was fire in the background, dancing in its orange rage, here were the black silhouettes of four figures in the foreground – man, woman, boys – whose personal tragedy was also a Miragian tragedy> It made the front page under the headline: The Birth of the Mahasen Era. <Miragian history tells us that some bloodlines have a cosmic responsibility to take the reins of our nation. This history tells us that such noble duties fall on only certain clans: the Facēnos, the Welakoti, and the Abeys. This history is so ingrained in us that the masses lead their lives thinking these clans urinate wine and defecate ice cream. It is now time to state the obvious: This Miragian history is patently false. The time of the so-called noble blooded is coming to an end. Yesterday we said our farewell to a true Miragian hero. He wasn’t born of noble blood. He was born in a home like ours. His worries were ours, our worries his. He was us. He was a hero and a true Miragian patriot - and if history is just it will record him as one. Yesterday the nation cremated this great Miragian but it will not allow his memory to pass. It must not. His work must continue. His vision must come true. May he Rest in Peace. EXCERPT FROM THE BIRTH OF THE MAHASEN ERA, The Miragian, BY JARLAP, A (3092[2592], October 10), pp. A1, A4> Hasyl never forgot the intimacy of that moment – and was secretly thankful to the brave photographer for daring to capture it. After Yami died giving birth to Dev three months later, Hasyl visited his school library to seek out this issue of The Miragian. There, as the librarian stood helpless, Hasyl cut out the photograph from the library’s copy and took the clipping home. 

Grief hung over the Mahasen home. Friends remarked among themselves that laughter, curiosity, surprise and joy would have left the Mahasen spirit completely had it not been for the infant Dev. All members of the Mahasen household gravitated towards the baby, seeking solace from their grief, except Jara and Hasyl. One day Hasyl walked by Dev’s nursery and heard his infant brother awake and crying. No one was in the room at the time. Hasyl entered the room and watched the tiny creature who not so much cried but screamed like a hundred terrified birds. He was a month old and this was the first time Hasyl had seen him properly. Why Hasyl asked the insolent creature did you have to come in and ruin everything? The question Hasyl posed the infant was built on the strength of his ten-year-old sense of logic: mother left this home and father to prepare for your arrival – our perfect family will no longer be whole without mother – your arrival killed mother – therefore you are to be blamed. For everything, little brother. Hasyl left the room, leaving his infant brother to cry. This silly assertion, that an infant was to blame for his family’s fate to forever court tragedy, would have died a natural death as he became older and wiser; instead Hasyl made the error of allowing the wound to fester, infecting other parts of his psyche. Hasyl’s anger turned into hate when he realized Manal was growing closer to, and protective of, the infant. It was this malady that convinced Jara to send his favourite son to military school so that he could reign in the rage before it was too late. 

‘You know why you must go?’ Jara asked Hasyl the night before he was to leave for military school. Hasyl nodded. ‘You know what you must do?’ Again, Hasyl nodded. 

When his two eldest sons were in their mid-teens, Jara knew who would become the politician and who would play the prodigal one. Manal was too open to ideas, not tethered to the vision of a Mahasen hegemony as Hasyl showed all the inclinations of being.  Hasyl was, on the other hand, obedient to his father’s every bidding, and knew why a certain thing was said – without any great pontificating on Jara’s part on the need to be moored to the family’s way, his way. But the anger threatened to derail Hasyl’s obvious aptitude for climbing the ladder. It was over an afternoon cup of tea with General Facēnos when the latter put forward the suggestion. Jara found the idea agreeable from the outset. Hasyl, too, agreed without hesitation when he was asked if he would consider a military career.  That phase of the plan was now in its fruition. 

‘Good lad. You’ve done well’, Jara repeated to Hasyl, looking at him straight in the eye. Both men sported a smile on their faces. <The subsequent photograph of this moment was never published on the papers, but Hasyl located the photographer and got himself a reprint.> 

****

‘You see those five stars right over the eastern horizon?’ 

Dev nodded. 

‘That’, Ana continued as they lay on a flat rock outside her family’s country home, ‘is Odonata, the dragonfly. Native Circadian mythology tells us how Odonata, the brave, virgin warrior goddess, would be invoked by chieftains when all hope was lost on the battlefield. If the chieftain was on the side of good and engaged in battle purely in the defence of his tribe then Odonata would respond to the call and defeat his enemies.’

But this is a dragonfly, not a woman. 

‘Let me finish, Dev. I’ll get to that’, Ana snapped. ‘The legend continues that one day, The Old Man, The Great Unknown, the lord of all gods happened upon Chief Ruku’s wife, Sta, bathing in the rivers. Enraptured by her beauty, The Old Man invokes all of nature – the birds, the wind, the water, the fish, the flowers - to sing a song in her name. When the song was done, The Old Man said, “I commanded all the world to sing an ode for ye, fair Sta. The world is at my feet. I am at thine. Be mine and thy beauty will be ageless from this moment!” Instead of being seduced by this act, Sta is left terrified. She refuses his advances despite knowing that this was the lord of all gods. The Great Unknown then whisks her away to his celestial abode and rapes her. When Chief Ruku hears of this, he orders all the temples built in The Great Unknown’s name to be burnt to the ground. This angers The Great Unknown who descends into the Circadian realms with the bruised Sta by his side. The Great Unknown burns every man, woman and child in Ruku’s tribe, making the helpless chief watch as each member of his tribe disintegrated in to ashes. The desperate Chief Ruku invokes Odonata then: “I beseech thee, warrior maiden. Aid us and we will forever be thy most devout servants.” The Great Unknown was Odonata’s great-great-great grandfather, but she was a kind and just Goddess, and not one to refuse her cosmic responsibility. She rode to meet The Old Man in battle. Upon seeing Odonata challenge him, The Old Man laughed so hard that the sky turned grey and it started raining and didn’t stop for another hundred years thereafter. Incensed, Odonata charged at him, her sword stopping inches from The Old Man’s face. The Great Unknown hadn’t moved. He smiles evilly at her instead. “Thou art the patriarch of all living things, Great Father! Please! I beseech thee: let these people live, set Sta free”, she begs him. The Old Man continues to smile menacingly. In tears, Odonata called on all her strength and plunged the sword into The Old Man’s face. Nothing happens to The Old Man, but Chief Ruku watches in horror as Odonata is sucked in, sword-first, into the unfathomable depths of The Great Unknown’s black eyes. The Old Man then spat her out. Cocooned in his saliva, Odonata’s form had changed. She was no longer the beautiful virgin warrior goddess. She was an insect unlike anything seen before. She had been turned into a dragonfly.  And that, Dev’, Anaka said, ‘is how I got my middle name, Odonata. Anaka-Odonata Ziromt.’ 

I can’t believe you’ve never told me your middle name before, and it is a beautiful name, Anaka-Odonata. 

Dev found himself lost in her again. Ten years had passed since he first met Anaka and her eccentric grandfather in an empty library. Ten years and it seemed everyday he found new reasons to go weak in her presence – and new ways of not being able to tell her the one truth. 

<Dev would grapple all his life with this concept of ‘The One Truth’. At seven, fermenting in his grandfather’s novel take on Miragian mythology, Dev’s submission for his school short story competition, titled ‘The War of the Shapes’, focussed on a fight for geometric superiority; essentially which shape was the most important for the sane functioning of the mortal world. The shapes fight one another in order to gain the affection of man. In the final battle, the Circle emerges as victor because man realizes it had always been, and always will be, the circle that best captured the geometry of his own fate. At seventeen, Dev penned a poem in three parts titled, ‘The One Truth’. In the poem he imagines the world anew, sans human presence except for Anaka and he, a world in genesis that they were tasked to populate with their progeny. The poem sets the scene of this new, virgin world, creates Dev and Anaka from the ashes of exploding stars, and charts their individual journeys over mountains, through swamps, and across deserts, in search of one another. When they finally find each other on top of a hill they realize, that in their haste to seek the other out, neither knew to speak. Unable to communicate their love for one another, they spend the rest of their lives quietly creating language, a Miragian tongue, so that they may finally utter ‘The One Truth’, their first utterance to one another. The poem’s devastating conclusion sees an old and weak Dev at Anaka’s deathbed. Grief-stricken and alone, unable to still put into words his loss, he finally blurts out the simple sentences he had spent his lifetime constructing, ‘The One Truth’: ‘I love you, Anaka. I have always loved you.’>

‘Go on. Open it.’ 

Dev tore the wrapping paper. Inside, framed in mahogany wood, was a wide-angle photograph of the blue planet as seen from the moon. The image was called ‘Gaiarise’. Breathless, Dev ran his fingers over the blue orb floating against inky darkness. 

‘We live and die in that fragile blue marble. This is home, Dev. This is here. I wish I could see this it for myself.’

It’s beautiful, Rejog. Thank you. 

‘You still want to live on the moon?’ 

I still want to live on the moon – if only to see this with my own eyes, Rejog. How did you get this?

‘The Circadian Space Agency presented this to me on my sixtieth. They had no idea I was – ‘  

What’s wrong? 

‘Nothing, nothing. They had no idea I was blind by then.’ Rejog’s laughter sounded like a lament. ‘Anyway, I’ve been wanting to pass it on to someone who would appreciate it. I thought of you.’ 

I am grateful. 

The library was as empty that day as it was when Dev first walked into it eight years before. Celebrating his birthday at the library with Rejog and Ana had become a tradition since the day he walked into Rejog’s room. Ana was arranging the tray with cake and tea. She hadn’t still wished Dev and the wait was maddening. 

‘Have you been viewing the moon through your telescope?’ Rejog’s question broke Dev from his reverie. 

Yes, Rejog. Every night. Full moon in two days.

‘Tea’s served, grandpa.’ ‘Thank you, dear. Happy birthday, Dev.’

Again, Dev looked in Ana’s direction. Again, she seemed to avoid his gaze. Why? Why hasn’t she wished me yet? Ana was helping Rejog with drinking his tea. When finished, she fed him a bite of the cake. ‘That’s all?’ Rejog asked. He sounded childlike in his disappointment. ‘That’s all’, Ana smiled but her voice was stern. ‘You are tougher to crack than your mother, Ana. Of that, there is no doubt.’ She kissed him on the cheek.  ‘Better’, Rejog said and smiled back. ‘You two can do as you wish. You don’t need to keep an old man company.’  ‘Does the old man wish to take his afternoon nap?’ The banter between grandfather and granddaughter was among the many things he enjoyed about their company. ‘The old man does wish to take his afternoon nap, yes.’ ‘That’s fine then’, Ana said and began to clear the table. ‘Dev, help me with these please?’ 

He kept looking for her eyes to meet his as they took the cups and tray back to the canteen, but again there was reticence. 

Stop. 

‘What?’  They were in a corridor leading to Rejog’s private office. 

You know I only celebrate my birthday with the two of you, right? Then why haven’t you wished me yet? 

Ana let out a deep sigh. ‘I am sorry. We took him to the doctor today for his check-up. His condition is getting worse. The doctor says –‘,Tears rolled down her eyes. Dev held her hands. ‘The doctor says he has a year to go – at most.’ She was weeping. Dev led her to one of the small study halls that characterized the top floor of the library. He sat near as she silently wept. When she was done, she looked up at him, eyes swollen, and forced a smile on her face. ‘Happy birthday, Dev. I am sorry you had to see this today.’

How is the family taking the news?

‘Mama isn’t handling it well. Papa, well, I don’t know if he knows. Not sure if he cares. Miragian diplomacy in more important than family! Sorry. Anyway, mama and I are taking grandpa to our country home. And that leads me to my birthday present for you.’ 

This is not the time, Ana. 

‘Shush, Master Mahasen’, she always teased by calling him that during arguments. 

Alright, I will. What is my birthday present then?

‘Come with us to the hill country.’

I’ve never been to the hill country. 

‘Precisely why you should come. Stay with us for a week. You’ll love it.’

I’d love to, Ana, but I am in the midst of – 

‘Dammit, boy. It’s your birthday!’, she was annoyed. ‘You’ve spent more time in your life inside a library or reading a book than you have outside in the midst of nature. The constant smell of musty old books might intoxicate your mind, but it won’t nourish your lungs. The hill country will. Trees will. Come with us.’ 

<Years later, as he sat looking at Gaia rising over the lunar horizon, the blue marble planet that was home to all those memories, Dev would recall his first visit to the Rackel country home as the happiest week of his life.> 

						****

They were at the Temple of Mirage <sometimes referred to as the Temple of Butterflies> atop Mirage’s Peak. Ana had taken him hiking in the three days since they arrived at her family’s country house. ‘I will make you walk, Dev Mahasen’, she teased him. ‘I will make you walk so much that your city boy legs will cry and beg for mercy.’ She kept to that promise. On the first day – ‘Since you are a city boy we’ll start with a simple walk through the forest’ – the hike started after breakfast; it was mid-afternoon under a scorching sun when they returned. The next day, she proposed that they climb the rock Shivagala. <Shivagala, according to the locals, was a rock that stubbed the toe of their First Ancestor, Shiva, cracking its peak.> Its flat summit meant the climb was less exhausting, but the April sun ensured they didn’t take it lightly. While enjoying the view at the summit, Ana said: ‘Tomorrow we climb Mirage’s Peak, we go to the Temple of Mirage. If the weather holds and it is a clear day, you’ll be able to see all of Mirage from the temple.’ 

They left the house after midnight the next day. The climb, an ascent up 10,000 stairs to the temple, would take about four hours. 

‘You are lucky.’

How is that now?

‘These stairs are usually crowded with people, sometimes as many as five thousand people climb on a single day. Today, we are the only ones.’ 

You’ve done this alone before?

‘Oh, plenty of times. When grandpa was young, he used to take mama up to the temple every month.’

I never thought of your grandfather as being religious. 

‘He wasn’t. He once found a Ghost Orchid, the rarest orchid in all of Pangaea, at the temple. That thing is called Ghost Orchid for a reason – it was mostly myth until it was properly collected and categorized fifty years ago. Anyway, he kept going there till he became blind, hoping to see it again, never did. Mama used to take me up as well until I started doing the climb myself.’ 

Did you ever see the Ghost Orchid?

‘No. Botanists have told grandpa that he probably never saw the Ghost Orchid either, that the climate up there is unsuitable for it to grow.’ 

Did he agree with them?

‘What do you think?’

Your grandfather can be a stubborn man.

Ana laughed. ‘That he can, yes – he didn’t give up chasing for it even after science told him he was wrong.’ Pause. ‘You are, in many ways, like him, Dev.’ 

How?

‘You can both be pig-headed with your obsessions for one.’ 

This is true. What else? 

‘Stubborn.’

I am not stubborn. 

She raised her eye brow and grinned. ‘See?’

Point taken. 

The talking stopped as the size of each stair became bigger, the effort greater, the air thinner. There were also dog faeces on the staircase to contend with.  

Can we rest a minute? 

Dev’s lungs were heaving. ‘We need to hurry if you want to see the sunrise, Dev! Besides, we are almost there. You can rest well when we reach the temple.’ 

Dev craned his neck up. He could hear the faint toll of bells from the temple in the distance, but couldn’t see anything because there was light mist cloaking it. 

‘Come on, Dev. The sun is about to rise.’ 

Dev looked around but couldn’t see Ana. 

Where are you? 

A few steps above, he saw a shadow from beyond the mist’s veil. Puncturing the ghostly curtain, Ana ran towards him, her face a grimace. Dev looked stupidly on as she got closer. Finally, she grabbed his arm and turned back towards the temple again. ‘Run, now!’ Ana made Dev run the last twenty stairs up to the temple. When they reached the summit, Dev fell to his feet, exhausted and panting heavily. Ana refused to let him be: ‘Stand up, Dev. Life is too short to miss this.’ She was right. Dev forgot the pain in his thighs and feet as he sighted the first ray of sunlight shoot out of the horizon.  The night black was replaced by a blue that itself was morphing into an orange. ‘What do you think? It is like someone lit a giant matchstick in the horizon, isn’t it?’ 

This place is quieter than a library. 

‘You are hopeless, Dev.’ 	

Hopelessly in love with you, Ana. 

The sun was now above the horizon. ‘Come on,’ Ana said. She walked towards the temple’s western walls. ‘This will be as magical.’ Again, she was right. Thousands of feet below the mountain’s western slopes, its shadow, a perfect triangle, crept along the carpet-like valley below. As the sun continued to ascend, the shadow stretched towards the furthest limits of Mirage. Like a giant arrowhead, the shadow pointed towards the eastern [Check on orientation. ][][][Is this right? ]borders of Mirage. ‘Beyond those rivers, there is Circadia[Is this right?]. Beyond that, the rest of the world awaits. Someday, Dev, I am going to see it all with my own eyes.’ 

That sounds like an obsession to me. 

She gave him a friendly punch. ‘So, aren’t you glad I dragged you out of the library now?’ 

‘But this is the greatest library in all of Mirage.’ The voice came from behind and startled them. 

‘Hello.’ The gauntly monk smiled, ‘I am sorry if I frightened you.’ There was a beatific quality of his presence that immediately put Dev and Ana at ease. 

‘Good morning, Brother’, Ana said recovering from the surprise. 

It was barely a minute since meeting him but Dev couldn’t remember anyone who had as ready a smile. ‘It is cold and you both look tired. Can I offer you hot tea?’ 

‘Thank you, brother[Brother not brother]. We’d love a cup of tea.’ 

‘I am sorry I have little to offer you in ways of food at the moment’, the monk said. 

‘That’s fine, Brother. We are not hungry.’ 

He led them to his corner, under the only tree at the summit. He already had company. Having their breakfasts were a dog, a cat, and a troupe of monkeys. Dev and Ana soon realized they were eating what meagre food the monk had for himself. Instead of chasing the offenders away, the monk patted the animals and let them continue eating.  He served the tea in two coconut shells. ‘What brings the two of you to the temple on such a day? The full moon isn’t due for another week and the temple priest isn’t here today.’ 

‘We are not here for the rituals, Brother’, Ana replied. ‘My friend Dev had never been here so I thought I’d show him the temple.’

‘Isn’t it beautiful here, Dev?’

It is, Brother. 

‘Tell me’, he said turning to Ana. ‘He is Dev. May I ask what your name is?’ 

‘Anaka, Brother.’

‘That’s a beautiful name. We name our girls Anaka too.’ 

‘You are a Circadian, yes?’  She realized his accent was familiar, but couldn’t place it. Now she knew for sure. 

‘I was born there’, the monk replied. 

‘How long have you been in Mirage, Brother?’ 

‘I entered through the forests three weeks back. I’d always heard of the magnificent Temple of Mirage on top of this mountain. I wanted to meditate here.’ 

You’ve been here alone all that while?

‘I came here as the head priest was locking up the temple.  He was going back to the valley until the next full moon. He invited me to stay here and meditate till then.’ 

You said that this was the greatest library in the world. What did you mean, Brother?

The question caught the monk by surprise. Ana reigned in a look of annoyance. ‘A library is a vessel of knowledge, is it not? But it asks us to rely on the minds of other men to attain this knowledge. After coming here, I’ve learnt that our own minds are in themselves one of the largest vessels of knowledge of the cosmos and our place in it, most of that knowledge is hidden too deep in our consciousness for us to attain. I have not attained that knowledge but I will – or I will die seeking it.’ 

Ana was done with her tea. Dev had barely drunk his. They said their farewells to the monk and prepared for their descent. The monk accompanied them to the stairs. ‘Thank you, my friends. Your company gave me great joy.’ 

‘Thank you for your hospitality, Brother’, Ana said and began her walk down. 

We don’t know your name, Brother. 

The monk replied, his smile widening, ‘I am Gaudharma Brunhha. Have a safe journey, Dev.’ 

Thank you, Brother Gaudharma. 

Ana barely spoke a word to Dev on their way down the mountain. 

***

A sea of Miragians clapped, waved and shouted his campaign slogan, ‘A Brighter Future!’ as Jara Mahasen waved back at the crowd. This was his moment. This would be spoken about in decades to come as the beginning of the Mahasen era of modern Miragian politics. ‘Thank you!’ Jara’s voice echoed across the promenade through the public speakers. ‘Thank you. May Mother Mirage Bless Us All!’ The response was thunderous. If he listened hard enough, he could hear and separate the gruff voices of the men in the crowd from the excitement of the women; and they were all screaming his name. As he stepped down from the stairs of the Miragian State Assembly he saw a boy in the front row of the crowd pleading for Jara to come his way. He must be Dev’s age that boy Jara thought and made his way to the lad. ‘Please, President Mahasen. Please, sir. Photo please, sir’, he shouted over the din. Jara gestured his bodyguards to bring the boy towards him. Making his way over the railing, the guard motioned for the boy to spread his arms so that he may be body-checked, but the boy cut to the guard’s left, and before the latter could stop him, the boy, his face now cloaked in anger, ran up the stairs and towards Jara. It was too late to react. The boy jumped towards him. Jara thought he heard a click before the world cut to black. 

There was ringing in his ears. When he put his finger in to try and clear the irritation, he felt the warm ooze of blood. He opened his eyes. There was smoke billowing besides him. Above, the sky hadn’t changed from the bright sunny day he remembered from a few minutes back. Wouldn’t these everyday miracles transform into monstrous manifestations of death’s coming? Is the sky still blue for the dead?  He moved his fingers; they responded. He moved his toes; they too were still attached. I am conscious, so my head is still...Jara tried to get up. It was difficult: his torso was buried under three other bodies. I am alive. How am I still alive? One by one, with what little energy he had left, Jara pushed aside the bodies and forced himself up. Had the bodyguards managed to somehow cover him from the force of the explosion? Smoke was still smouldering around him. Jara scanned the surroundings, looking for other survivors. Nothing moved around him except for a murder of crows circling above the mass of bodies and blood.  How am I still alive and everyone else dead?

One crow swooped down towards where the railings had stood a few minutes before. Jara eyed the errant bird, a voice in his head telling him what it was about to do. And the crow did exactly that: it hopped towards a body and pecked at the corpse’s eyes. Horrified, Jara ran down the steps towards the bird, but by now the other crows too had started to descend into this morbid buffet. Each seemed to prefer the eyes of the corpses. Jara watched one bird fly away with an eyeball between its beaks.  ‘Help! Somebody, help!’ Jara shouted. ‘Someone please help me!’ 

Another bird landed on a corpse’s head, closer to Jara this time. The crow had its back turned from Jara. Time to time, it would bend down, peck at the eyes below its feet, and look up towards the horizon again[In the distance?]. Jara looked around: there was a pole at his feet. Picking it up, he swung at the unsuspecting bird. It had just bent towards the head to peck again when it felt the full brunt of Jara’s blow. Squawking in pain, the crow, unable to fly away, hobbled around in panic. Jara went after it, but then his brain recognized a familiar face in his peripheral vision. Jara turned to the corpse on which the crow had been feasting on. 

That face. It can’t be. No. 

The face, sans left eye-ball and bleeding from its mouth, sported a manic smile. No, No! This is not happening! Yara Mahasen’s face looked like he did the day he was butchered - as if that exact moment of his death had been captured by a master sculptor. ‘Remember, Jara: For a Brighter Future!’ Yara’s head cackled. ‘FOR A BRIGHTER FUTURE!’ Jara closed his eyes as he felt the encroaching of madness, but the cries got louder still – ‘A BRIGHTER FUTURE!’ – like the volume of a PA speaker increased to unbearable levels. His curiosity getting the better of him, Jara opened his eyes. Around him were countless heads of Yara Mahasen, attached to the countless dead - men, women and children. They were all chorusing: ‘A BRIGHTER FUTURE!’  

‘Are you alright, Mr Mahasen?’ 

Ohiy was looking at him in concern. He looked around: he was in his room. 

‘It was just a dream’, Jara said gasping, his face soaked in panic sweat. 

‘Just a dream.’

‘Yes, you had a bad dream. Are you alright?’ 

‘I am. What time is it?’ 

‘It’s Six. You asked me to wake you up. Today is the big day. Your staff members are already downstairs. Your clothes for today are ready. I placed them on the divan.’ 

‘Thank you, Miss Ohiy’, Jara was starting to orient himself again. ‘I’m sorry if I frightened you.’ 

‘You did no such thing. Up now. You need to eat before you leave. Breakfast is ready as well.’

Jara got up from the bed as Ohiy was making her way out of the room. ‘Miss Ohiy?’ She stopped and turned back. 

‘Err...My sheets need changing. Can you ask the servants to be discreet –‘

‘I will take care of the sheets personally, Mr Mahasen.’

‘No! What? No. And stop calling me Mr Mahasen in private. I’ve told you – ‘

‘Jara’, Ohiy cut him off. ‘I’ve known you since the moment you came into this world. I held you in that prison hospital before your mother did. I’ve raised you and your three sons. This is not the time to be embarrassed.’ 

Jara was always left flabbergasted at her dedication to his family. ‘Thank you, Miss Ohiy.’ 

‘Get ready soon. Breakfast will be served in ten minutes. And Jara?’

‘Yes, Miss Ohiy.’ 

‘I hope you’ll pay a visit to your mother before you leave the house. She’ll like that. You’ve barely seen her in the last few months.’ 

‘Yes’, Jara agreed. ‘Yes, I will.’ 

					***

‘Good morning, Father’, Hasyl always stood when his father walked into the room. Manal had already served himself a plate and was eating. ‘Morning, Hasyl. Morning, Manal’, his tone changed between the two greetings betraying his views on his sons. Manal feigned politeness and mumbled the greeting back while chewing his food. ‘Where is Dev?’ His question was pointed towards Manal. Hasyl too looked in the direction of his older brother. Manal, still eating, took a while to register the eyes on him. ‘What?’ ‘Where is Dev?’ Jara repeated. ‘How’, Manal spoke slowly while munching a mouthful, ‘am I supposed to know the whereabouts of a seventeen year old? For all I know, he spends nights at the library.’ 

Ohiy walked in the midst of this tense exchange. ‘Can’t I leave you three in a room for five minutes and expect to come back to peace and quiet?’ ‘This is peace and quiet, Miss Ohiy’, Manal retorted. ‘Just an uneasy one.’ ‘Try harder at sounding a smartass, Manal. You’ll know when you do.’ ‘And how is that, Miss Ohiy?’ Manal was chuckling. ‘You’ll receive a thrashing from me at that point.’ The chuckling stopped. ‘Miss Ohiy, where is Dev?’ Jara interrupted. ‘He isn’t trying to miss today’s ceremony, is he?’ Ohiy motioned everyone to take their seats. She took her place at the table. ‘Dev is at Ana’s place.’ ‘Miss Ohiy’, Jara started. ‘He will be there at the ceremony. He promised’, Ohiy reassured him. ‘She’s leaving today, that girl.’ The breakfast was otherwise uneventful and completely devoid of conversation. When he was done, Jara’s secretary entered. ‘Sir, it is time.’ Jara stood and looked at the table. ‘I will see you all at the assembly today. Be on time.’ Hasyl stood and saluted, ‘Good luck, father.’ 

‘Can I bring a camera?’ 

‘What?’ Jara snarled. 

‘I asked if it was okay to bring my camera? I’d like to photograph it. Not every day –‘

‘How are you this naive?’ Jara asked. ‘How? How, Manal?’ Tell me: what would it look when I am taking the oath and my eldest son is clicking photographs like a member of the media.’ 

‘How do you manage to make that sound like a horrible thing?’

‘Enough! Enough. I will see you at the assembly with your brothers, your grandmother and Miss Ohiy. I will see you in the front row. I will see you dressed well and clean-shaven, like the son of a president ought to be. I will see you smile and be polite to all those important people who will sit around you. And, above all, I won’t – and let me repeat this so it goes through your thick skull – I won’t see you carrying a camera. Is that clear?’ Manal nodded. Jara stormed out. Hasyl was brooding by the table. 

‘Did you have to?’ 

‘Did I have to what?’ Manal asked. 

‘Did you have to make it difficult for him today?’ 
‘Hold on there, Captain Mirage, I was just asking –‘ Hasyl strode closer to Manal then, cutting the latter off mid-sentence. ‘You will go about today exactly as father said you will’, he rasped. ‘Do you understand me?’ 

‘Or else? Or else what, Hasyl?’ he realized then he no longer had any physical advantage over his younger brother. ‘You think that fucking uniform allows you to say whatever the fuck you want?’

‘Stop it! Both of you’, Ohiy voice was as assertive as it was when the Mahasen men were boys. Even now it commanded respect. ‘This is disgraceful! Have you any idea how many strangers are inside this house right now? Do you? What would they think? Hasyl, you are to go with your father’s entourage, yes?’ Hasyl, eyes still on Manal, nodded his head. ‘Then leave.’ Hasyl walked backwards, a cold smile stretched across his face, and eyes still on Manal. 

‘Fuck you, you pissant’, Manal shouted as Hasyl finally turned and left the room. 

‘Manal’, Ohiy’s voice was now terse, ‘If you don’t shut it, I will give you a thrashing. I don’t care how old you are, but Mother Mirage help me for I will give you a thrashing you won’t forget.’ 

‘Miss Ohiy, you saw what –‘ 

‘I don’t care! Find your brother. Bring him back here’, she started to clear the table. ‘And shower! Don’t think I don’t know what you do in your room all day.’ 

					****

Rejog’s condition worsened in the weeks leading to Jara’s election triumph. Ana and her mother divided their time in taking care of the old man’s needs. Dev was in class one afternoon when he received an urgent message from Ana: ‘Grandpa is asking for you. Pls come soon.’ Rushing to the Ziromt residence, Dev found Ana and her mother, Tysa, anxious outside Rejog’s room. ‘He’s been asking for you all day’, Ana said before she opened the door to Rejog’s room. ‘Try to sound normal. He’ll snap if he hears any sympathy.’ Dev closed the door behind and stood near it for a while. Rejog had thinned considerably. His breathing was raspy. Most of the curtains were drawn, but sunlight crept through a narrow opening and was bathing the left side of his face. 

‘Who is it?’ Rejog’s voice, though strained, reminded him of that moment almost a decade ago when Dev had walked into the old man’s office. 

It’s me, Rejog.

‘Sit beside me.’ Dev pulled a chair and sat by the bedside. ‘Where are you?’ 

Here, Rejog. I am right here. 

Dev placed his hand on Rejog’s. The old man held it. ‘Thank you for coming, Dev. I am sorry if you had to miss class on my account.’ 

That’s alright, Rejog. I’d rather be here with you. 

‘Thank you, my boy. You are probably wondering why I was so impatient to see you.’ 

Yes, I am. What can I do for you, Rejog?

‘I want to tell you a story, Dev.’ 

I like stories. You know that. 

‘You know I knew your grandfather?’ 

Yes, that was the first thing you ever told me, Rejog. 

‘Yara was not a best friend - he was like my brother. It is only right that I tell you what I should have told him, what I was too ashamed to tell him. But I will die soon and my only concern is that I don’t have this burden on mind when my time comes.’ Dev tightened his fingers around the old man’s hands. 

I am listening, Rejog.  

‘I was in love with your grandmother, Dev. I am still in love with Ella.’ He paused, giving Dev a moment to let the jolt soak in. If he was surprised, Dev didn’t let his hands betray it. Rejog continued, ‘I fell in love with your grandmother the day Yara introduced me to her as his future wife. I tried to ignore that first moment when I lost myself in her eyes, I tried to put it to the back of my mind, bury it like the cancer that it was. I should have been happy for Yara. Instead, I drunk myself silly and entered the greatest brothel in all of Mirage and didn’t leave for two days – until I was sure I had exorcised that first memory of Ella. They got married. And then he got into trouble because of those protests. Nothing, Dev, nothing has angered me more in life than seeing them treat Yara and Ella like that. The police, those scum beat them like animals. Like animals, Dev. I knew Yara was prepared for this, but Ella – she was only a teenager then. I tried to get them out. I tried, Dev. I tried everything, but the government wouldn’t do anything until the uprising of the working-class was quelled. On the day they were to be set free, I drove to the prisons to pick them up. First to Yara and then to Ella. I was so happy to see Yara again. We were waiting for an hour outside the women’s prison when the doors finally opened. And there she was. Your grandmother bearing a child. Prison ruins the spirit, Dev. I’ve seen it. My father spent a year in prison and when he came back, we barely recognized him. Not, Ella’s spirit. Not your grandmother’s. She now had the maternal glow. I realized before we all got into the car that I had never stopped loving Ella, that I had been in denial all along. Everyday thereafter was a battle between the demons of my heart and cold logic of my mind. Little by little, as Yara became more and more powerful a politician, I stopped visiting them. It was, in my mind, the only course of action. Even with hindsight, I do not think I would do anything differently. I loved your grandfather, Dev, but I loved Ella more. Instead of choosing one or the other, I deprived myself of both. Your grandfather thought I stopped talking and associating with him because of his politics. “You rich prick!”, he shouted on the day he finally confronted me about my distancing myself from him. “You rich boys, you sit back and there is money being made in your name, enough wealth to last generations. But here I am trying to come up, change my destiny, change Mirage’s destiny so that people from my background don’t have to suffer as I did - and you won’t have it, Rejog! You are an envious, rich cunt who doesn’t want to show other envious, rich cunts that you have anything to do with a dirty low-born commoner like me!” He stormed off. I did nothing to stop him. We never spoke again.’  Rejog was weeping. Dev wiped the Rejog’s tears away. 

Would you like to talk to my grandmother?

‘I see her in my dreams every night, Dev. I got married, had a daughter, a granddaughter who is the shining beacon of all the joy in my life, but every night Ella haunts my dreams. She haunts me to this day. She was the unattainable one. Ella. Ella. Ella’, tears continued to pour down. ‘My dying wish, Dev, is that I tell her the one thing I know to be true ever since the day I met her.’ 

Stop crying. Please. I’ll bring aach to you. 

Ana and Tysa were waiting outside the room when Dev finally walked out. He sat them down and repeated what Rejog had told him. They greeted the news with surprising ease. ‘I’ve always known there was someone else he longed for’, Tysa said when Dev was done. ‘Reading his work when I was an adult, it is fairly obvious none of it was inspired by mother.’  

Dev rushed back home. He knew the only way he could get his grandmother to travel was to let Ohiy arrange the whole thing. His first task was then to convince Ohiy. When Ohiy recovered from Dev’s telling of the story, she beckoned the nurse and told her what needed to be done. With the nurse’s help, Ohiy bathed and dressed Ella. Within the hour, Ohiy, Ella and the nurse were in the family car being driven to Ana’s home. Throughout Ella was particularly cooperative though she had no idea where she was being taken.  It was at the Ziromt hall that Ella froze. Her attention was grabbed by a photograph. No one said a word as they saw the Mahasen matriarch grapple with her memory, coaxing it to remember the faces in the photo. Dev stepped closer to her. 

That’s you and paataach on the right.

‘Yes, it is.’ 

He looks very handsome, aach.

She giggled, almost girl-like. ‘But this man...I know him too.’ 

Yes, you do. That’s – 

‘- that’s Rejog!’ she exclaimed, glowing in the aftermath of having won this battle with her fading memory. 

Would you like to see him? 

‘Yes! It’s been years since I saw Rejog. He hardly visits anymore[Barely comes to visit? Or he barely visits. ].’ 

Dev guided Ella into Rejog’s room. The old man was lying down exactly as Dev had left him, but there was a thin, dusty manuscript left unopened by his bed table now.  ‘Ella?’ Rejog’s voice sounded different to when Dev had heard earlier in the afternoon. ‘Rejog, is that really you?’ 

‘Yes it’s me. It’s Rejog. Come here, Ella.’ 

Dev led Ella to the seat and sat her down. Ana, meanwhile, adjusting Rejog’s blanket asked if he needed anything else: ‘Yes. Leave us.’ No one was prepared for this. ‘Now’, Rejog’s voice was more insistent.  Ohiy nodded her head to Dev, Tysa beckoned Ana; they closed the door lightly. 
Hours went by. From time to time, Ohiy or Tysa would open the door, taking care to not make a sound, and peep their heads in to ensure the Rejog and Ella were okay. Ana peeped in at one time and returned to the rest of the party sporting a smile on her face: ‘I heard laughter - from both of them.’ It was late around dinner time when Rejog called for Tysa.  As Ohiy and Dev went by Ella’s sides to help her up, she laid her hands on Rejog’s chest. Finding the hand, he lifted it to his face and kissed it. ‘Stay for a minute, Dev’, Rejog said as the party dispersed. ‘I need to give you something.’ When the room was empty again, Rejog motioned towards the dusty manuscript that was on his bed table. ‘That, Dev’, Rejog began, ‘is everything I wrote for Ella when I fell in love with your grandmother. Writing it was the only reason I didn’t descend into madness. I want you to have it. It’s yours now.’ 

‘And, Dev?’ He was at the door and turned back to Rejog. ‘Give her time. Ana doesn’t like cages. You do. Give her time and she’ll come around. Not now.’ Dev opened the manuscript on his way back home. It was titled ‘The Ghost Orchid: An Anthology of Poems for The Unattainable One’.

						***

It was dawn and Dev was reading Rejog’s The Ghost Orchid when he heard the news: the old man had passed away peacefully during the night. Ana was inconsolable. Dev tried his best to see her in the two days leading to the funeral but to no avail. ‘I am sorry, Dev’, Tysa said seeing the hurt in the boy’s eyes: ‘Give her time. She was very fond of her grandfather.’ 

The funeral was attended by over 20,000 people. Politicians, scientists, artists and writers paid their last respects <to a man The Miragian newspaper called ‘...the most influential voice in Mirage’s education system in the last three decades.’>. Dev’s family too paid their respects. Ella had already forgotten the man who had, less than a week ago, confessed to being in love with her almost all his adult life. As far as Jara was concerned, he was doing what was expected of a Miragian statesman and its future President; he knew nothing of his parents’ history with Rejog. 

Ana was by her mother’s side as the funeral pyre began to slowly crumble from the furnace within its body. When it was dusk and the pyre had done its work, Ana finally turned to Dev and spoke to him. ‘Come home with me, Dev. I have something for you.’ Ana led Dev to Rejog’s room. On his bed was a box full of books. ‘He wanted you to have all of this as well’, Ana pointed and said. 

I can’t, Ana. All of this is rightfully yours. 

‘My grandfather knew me better than you do, don’t forget that. He told me a few nights before he died that this box should reach you. In it, are his favourite books. They are all for you.’ Dev was astonished. He wasn’t prepared for this at all. 

Alright, I’ll keep them carefully. If you ever change your mind, Ana – 

‘- I won’t, believe me. I have no use for them.’ She noticed that her tone had hurt him. ‘I am sorry, Dev. I was preparing myself for his death, but not well enough it looks like.’

What are you going to do? 

‘I want to go to the countryside for a few days - that is what I want to do. Come with me.’ 

They spent a week at the country home. Ana was keen on hiking and most of their days were spent visiting the same places. Mirage Peak was crowded this time as the full moon was two days prior. The Circadian monk Gaudharma was nowhere to be seen much to Dev’s disappointment. Ana made no mention of him. They were serving dinner later that evening when Ana exclaimed, ‘I know what we can do. Stay right here, Dev! Give me a few minutes’, and ran outside, leaving her barely-served plate. ‘You keep eating!’, she shouted on her way out, ‘I’ll be right back.’ Ana was prone to moments of proclamations. She gave the impression that it was impulsiveness, but Dev had learnt over the years that it wasn’t really the case: she’d planned it all along, worked out the likelihood of her mad plans succeeding, and only then would she announce it to Dev when he least expected it. This was no different. What has she cooked up this time?

He finished dinner and cleared the plates waiting for her to return. Ana shouted from outside the hall, ‘Don’t come out yet! Stay right where you are.’  Dev walked around the dining room, examining the family photographs. There was Rejog and his wife, Ana’s parents as newly-weds and them as new parents, holding the infant Ana in their hands. There was one of Anaka from school, much older, closer to Dev’s first memory of her from the afternoon in the library all those years ago. Below it, a caption: ‘ANAKA-ODONATA ZIROMT, Outstanding Student, Form V’. Her face was more freckled then, auburn hair tied back in a pony-tail, unsmiling. 

‘Okay, Dev!’ she had her hands in the air, ‘I have a surprise. Follow me.’ 

What madness have you planned this time, Anaka-Odonata?

She stopped, turned around and laughed. ‘Now how did you come to know my middle name then, Master Mahasen?’ 

School photograph. You are looking very friendly.

‘Ha! My teachers couldn’t get me to smile no matter what. The cameraman was the rudest idiot.’

She was leading him down the hall and to the front door. ‘Now’, she turned back to him again, ‘close your eyes. Come on.’ Dev did. She held him by his hands and led him outside. ‘Alright, open your eyes now.’ Anaka had laid cushions on the flat rock that stood in the centre of the garden. ‘I want to spend the night watching the stars with you.’  It was a clear night, not a cloud in the sky and the light of stars illuminated everything around them. Neither spoke for a long time. 

Odonata is an interesting name. 

Dev’s comical interjection into the complete silence of the night made Ana laugh. She pointed at the five-starred constellation and related the mythology it had inspired among Circadians, and how that in turn had inspired Rejog to suggest Odonata as Ana’s middle name. 

I can’t believe you’ve never told me your middle name before - and it is a beautiful name, Anaka-Odonata. 

Dev found himself lost in her again. Ten years had passed since he first met Anaka and her eccentric grandfather in an empty library. Ten years and it seemed everyday he found new reasons to go weak in her presence – and new ways of not being able to tell her the one truth. 

He kissed her, starting with her forehead, then her eyes and finally her lips. Ana didn’t resist but pushed him gently back after their lips touched. ‘Why did it take you this long?’ There was resignation in her voice. Rejog’s last words to him echoed in Dev’s head then.

I wasn’t sure. 

‘Sure of what exactly?’  

I wasn’t sure if you felt the same. 

‘How are you now sure I feel the same?’ There was whiplash in the question. 

I am not, Ana. I am not. This moment felt right. 

‘Right now?’ 

Yes. 

‘Felt right?’ 

Yes. 

Ana drew in her breadth. ‘I’ve waited for you to tell me for so long, Dev. So fucking long. And it isn’t like you didn’t have the opportunity. We’ve spent days together! And yet you never said a word.’

Ana, I am sorry I wasn’t – 

‘- I am not done yet. Don’t interrupt me’, she was struggling to ensure her voice was neutral. ‘You remember the first time we climbed Mirage Peak?’ 

Yes. 

‘All it took was some hermit’s insane ramblings for you to completely forget me.’ 

Ana it isn’t – 

‘ - Stop fucking interrupting! I realized on our way the mountain that day that the only people you could relate to are the hermits and people like my grandfather. And you are not going to change. I know this.’ 

That is not true. 

‘Really? Dev, are you joking when you say you want to live on the moon?’ 

No, but that won’t happen. The chances of me – look, Ana only 30 men have ever walked the moon! – no one has lived there yet. It might happen in my lifetime, but me? It is just a foolish dream – 

She sighed, ‘How naive are you, Dev? You want to know everything about everything but you don’t know yourself. You forget I saw your face when that hermit said that bullshit about the temple being the greatest library in the world.’ 

I am sorry, Ana. 

‘Don’t apologize. Don’t you ever apologize for being who you are. Inside you there is a voice that constantly asks you to seek solitude. Inside of me there is a voice that is constantly asking me to see new things, meet new people.’ 

What are you saying?

‘I am leaving Mirage, Dev. You want to live on another world. I want to see all of this world, I want to travel to every corner of Pangaea.’ Dev hoped that the intensity of his beating heart and the quickness of his breathing was not noticeable. ‘Now that grandpa is dead, I have no reason to stay here.’ 

Aren’t I a reason? 

‘You are a reason to come back, Dev - If you are here at all -’

-I’ll be here. I’ll wait.  I only want to make you happy.

She ignored the interruption this time. ‘- But you aren’t a reason to stay. I am leaving for Circadia next week with my parents. Next week you become the youngest son of the youngest President in Miragian history. Next week my father will show my mother and I off to the diplomatic community in Circadia.’ Pause: ‘Next week our lives will change. But tonight, Dev Mahasen’, the smile returned again and Dev felt something deep inside of him leap up in joy at the sight of her smiling face – and that very thing then imploded. ‘Tonight, we have the stars, you and I.’ 

We do. 

Later that night Dev and Ana watched a spectacular meteor shower above them. When it was done, Ana, her head resting on Dev’s chest, turned to him, ‘I am sleepy. You?’ 

Not yet, but it is getting colder. We should go in.

 She was at the entrance to her room when she turned back. ‘What are you going to do?’ 

I’ll write for a while. I can’t sleep now. 

‘Can I watch you write until I fall asleep?’

Or can I write while I watch you sleep, Ana? Sure, you can. I’d love the company. 

‘Writers don’t like company, Dev. You should know that by now’, she chided him.  

Dev tucked Ana in bed and made his way to the writing table near the window. ‘What are you writing and when am I going to read any of it?’ 

A poem. One day I’ll let you read all of my writing.  

‘What’s the poem called?’ 

The One Truth. 

‘”The One Truth”, eh? The one truth, Master Mahasen, is that there is a world outside those pages you spend every waking hour poring over, the one truth is that you need to get out more – before you live on the moon!’, she teased. ‘I don’t know what you are going to do without me.’ With no clever retort, Dev managed to smile stupidly in response. Neither do I, Ana. Neither do I. He spent the rest of the night watching her sleep while adding more lines to the poem <The One Truth was promising to be a lengthy affair even at this early, work-in-progress stage>.

 ‘Manal, where is your brother? I asked you to bring him’, Ohiy’s voice was threatening even when she whispered. The Miragian State Assembly was bathed in sunshine. Dignitaries from all walks of life were gathered to watch Jara Mahasen sworn in as the fifteenth President of the United Tribes of Mirage. 

‘I couldn’t find him, Miss Ohiy.’

‘What do you mean you couldn’t find him? He’s at Ana’s house.’ 

‘He was, Miss Ohiy’, Manal said. ‘He decided to go with her to the airport.’ 

Ohiy shook her head, ‘Stupid child. Stupid, stupid boy.’ 

					***

 In the days leading up to her departure, Dev and Ana spent whatever time they could with one another. Often, they spent it in complete silence; Dev because he was afraid opening his mouth would cause a torrent of words proclaiming his love for Ana while she feared anything she said now would irrevocably hurt him.  It was a strange week, but one they had enacted before when they met first as children. Even then his shyness had made it difficult for Ana to get through to him. The night before she was to leave, before Jara was to be sworn in as President, Ana and Dev walked the corridors of the library together for the last time. Everything smelled of Rejog. <Or did Rejog smell like old books?> Ana even remembered the game of hide-and-seek they had played in the giant library when they were children. After much goading, Dev agreed and they played their last game. She hid, rather obviously, in Rejog’s old office. Still, Dev wouldn’t have found her if it wasn’t for the sobbing echoing around the hallways. 

‘I miss him, Dev. I miss him every day.’ 	

I miss him too. He was very proud of you, Ana. You were the joy in his life.

You are the only joy in mine. 

She pulled him closer. The dusty floor creaked as they fumbled taking each other’s clothes off - like it was laughing at their comic cluelessness with the mechanics of foreplay. The love-making was hurried, both bodies unfamiliar with rhythm or tempo, both minds unable to reconcile ideas with action. Dev was lost in the sweet odour of Anaka’s neck and breasts. You are a Goddess, he whispered into her ears as Anaka’s breathing became louder and embrace tighter, plunging him deeper into her so that Dev could lose himself in her like she knew he had wanted to ever since they passed the awkward first years of puberty. They fell asleep on the floor with nothing to protect them from the dust and insects except for their coital sweat and tears. 

The next morning, they rushed to the Ziromt home that was on the verge of mild panic. At her gate, Ana turned back and faced Dev. ‘So, this is goodbye then?’ 

No. 

‘What?’ 

I mean – let me see you off at the airport. 

‘Master Mahasen, have you completely lost it? Your father is due to be sworn in today. You have to be there.’ 

I can watch the swearing in ceremony from any vision screen at the airport. I’d rather see you off. 

‘Dev, you do realize your father will become my father’s boss by day’s end, right? And my father won’t agree –‘

-He doesn’t have to know. I’ll get to the airport before you do. 

‘You are dusty, dirty and quite possibly mad.’ 

Possibly explains why we are friends, doesn’t it? 

‘Possibly’, she grinned. ‘Are you sure? Your father won’t be pleased.’ 

Nothing I do will ever please him. It doesn’t matter, Ana. I’ll see you around 11 at the airport.

The crows circled above as Jara scanned his surroundings. This was only the beginning. This was what his father yearned for but was cruelly deprived of it by cowards. No matter. In the grand scheme of things, the writing of the first chapters of the Mahasen legend had only been postponed, not prevented, from being committed to the pages of history. Jara would write the opening chapters. Hasyl will take my place thereafter, I am sure of it. His eyes sought his family. He picked out Ella from the VIP section. Dressed in all white, Ella looked radiant – and it was all thanks to the endless reservoir of energy and selfless dedication that Ohiy possessed. He tried locking eyes with his mother’s but hers was vacant. Her eyes might be open, but her mind was already wandering, where Jara had no clue. Ohiy sat by her side. Could she, Jara wondered, have ever imagined that she would go from inmate to now attending a Presidential swearing-in ceremony? Ohiy’s eyes met his. They smiled at one another. Thank you everything Jara tried saying to her with his eyes. She understood – she always did – and nodded. It was Ohiy who had the glow of maternal pride, not Ella. Hasyl was by his grandmother’s side on her left. Dressed in military uniform, he looked much older than his 27. Above all, Hasyl looked ready to play his part. To Ohiy’s right was Manal. He was feigning interest, but Jara had to admit: Manal had, for once, followed his every command in dressing for the occasion. But wait. Where is Dev? Jara’s eyes scanned the row his family was sitting in. Where is Dev?! 

The Trinity walked on stage. The ceremony was ready to begin. The Miragian flag was raised and its anthem sung. The air of optimism in the crowd was tangible: it seemed everyone belted the song out from the core of their beings. 

Where is Dev? Jara craned his neck as the flag rose. The cloudless sky was all blue except for the crows, those damn crows. The anthem was done. Everyone sat down. <The Trinity – Prophet Saman CCCLIII, Prophet Shiva CCCXL and Prophet CCCXLV in this case – represented the religious apex of Miragian society. Each Prophet was chosen according to a three-thousand-year tradition: the identification of boys born of Immaculate Conception, their education in the ancient ways of their tribe for years before the standing Prophet of the tribe died. That would be the time would for one of these boys, the wisest of the lot, to assume the role of Prophet for their tribes. Together, the Trinity had provided spiritual council to Mirage’s political leadership over the centuries since the founding of the nation.>   

The Trinity stood and approached the podium. Together, they sang the words of invocation to Mother Mirage: ‘Water. Wind. Soil. Fire. You manifest in all that was, all that is, and all that ever will be. You who, in your infinite bounty, hath bequeathed us this land, to you we pay homage, children to Mother.’ The Trinity made the sign of Mother Mirage <arms bent, fingers together and hands pointing skywards, palms turned inwards>: ‘In eternal servitude’, the Trinity said. The crowd repeated the phrase. 

‘We are here today’, Prophet Saman CCCLIII began, ‘to begin anew. Our nation – every Samanian, Shivaputra and Adamite among you – has spoken: Jara Mahasen will lead us into the next decade. He takes on a solemn responsibility, for the Presidency of Mirage is not merely a political responsibility as it may be with our neighbours, but a cosmic one. Jara Mahasen will today be the fifteenth President of our blessed nation. Over these two centuries, the role of Miragian President has been bestowed by the people of Mirage to a select few who have understood Mirage’s place as unique in this tapestry of nations that we call Pangaea. Jara Mahasen’, the Prophet turned to face him. ‘Please approach us.’ The Trinity stood at the centre of the stage. The Trinity placed their right palms on top of one another’s, Prophet Saman’s being the top-most; on this they carefully laid the Book of Mirage <considered to be the foundational document of the Miragian nation>, they then bent their left hand, brought the fingers together and pointed towards them towards the sky, with palms facing inwards. ‘Place your right hand on this book and repeat after us, Jara Mahasen.’ Jara quickly scanned his surroundings again. Above him the crows still fluttered. He placed his right hand on the Book and his left hand bent, palms facing him. 

‘I, Jara Mahasen’, the Trinity [Recited in union]began. 

						***

Dev watched his father on the Vision Screen and felt nothing. He was at the airport. People had milled around him, eager to see the new President officially begin his duties. No one, evidently, had any idea that that new president’s youngest was amongst them at that very moment. ‘[Geo politics and domestic politics need to be alluded to. ]Right man for the job, that’s what I say. Almost voted for his father, but then those bastards murdered him.’ ‘Ay, time to bring some equality into this country – and tell outsiders to mind their own business.’ 

More voices agreed with the first two. Someone clapped as the Trinity’s invocation of Mother Mirage was over. Dev felt a hand on his shoulder. ‘I hope we didn’t keep you waiting.’ 

‘Your father looks very happy’, she whispered to his ear. Ana looked resplendent.

Well this is what grandfather and he have wanted all their lives. Now he has it.  

The oath was about to begin. The crowd got heavier. Dev took Ana by the hand and walked away from the crowd. ‘You must be proud of your father, Dev.’

Ana, can we not talk about my father now? Please?

‘Alright, I am sorry.’ 

Do your parents know I am here?

‘Mama does. We didn’t tell papa because he might panic.’ 

And what did your mother say?

‘Exactly what I said.’ 

The crowd in front of the vision screen was silent now as the Trinity called on Jara to approach them and take his oath. 

					***

‘..and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United Tribes of Mirage.’ Jara immediately felt a great weight press against his head as the last words rolled out of his tongue.  This is happening. There is no turning back now. The crows were still above, but their numbers had dwindled. One perched atop the flagpole. Jara thought he heard clapping. He turned towards the crowd and indeed there was applause. People were standing and clapping. He waved and flashed the smile he had spent an entire month perfecting in front of the mirror. 

					***

‘Well, there you go’, Ana turned towards Dev as the screen showed Jara waving to the crowds. The crowd at the airport too waved back at the screen, some clapped, some whistled. ‘It is done. Your life will change now.’

Not everything, Ana. Before I forget: I want you to have this. 

‘What’s this?’ Ana sized up the thick envelope. 

It’s the poem. 

‘You finished it?’ Ana was excited. 

Yes, but don’t read it now. Today is about you and not me. Open it if you ever feel lonely during your many travels.

‘So’, the mischievous grin appeared on her face, ‘What then is the “The One Truth”, Dev?’

You’ll see when you read it.  

From behind a voice called for Ana. It was Tysa. ‘Boarding call’, Ana explained. Dev’s eyes could no longer look at hers. 

Right. You best get going. 

‘I am going to miss you, Master Dev Mahasen.’

I am going to miss you too, Anaka-Odonata Ziromt. More than you will ever know. 

She leaned in and kissed him. 

‘I’ll write to you.’ 

I will too. 

‘Goodbye, Dev.’

Bye. I’ll wait for you, Ana. I promise. I hope you know that.  

Their eyes met again for a final time. She tried smiling with her eyes, but there was no mirth now. Only sadness. Dev felt the implosion within him again as she turned around and walked away. She waved at him one last time. He waved back. I’ll wait, Ana. I’ll wait.

　　　　PART II: 
The Flight of the Dragonfly 


Like a dragonfly you exist
In a moment in my memory
Cocooned in that space and time
But forever free to float
In unfathomable flight above me;
And I lie stagnant
Pondering what redemptive magic
Brought you to me at all -
And what sorcery took you away.





















The Miragian Moon Temple was built in the likeness of the Temple of Butterflies on Mirage Peak, but it differed in significant ways: the lunar counterpart was considerably larger, it possessed a meditation deck just below the spire, and it was a technological marvel. It was from here Dev contemplated the delicate Gaia, high above the horizon. It would be the new moon down there, but here on the moon, it was Full Gaia, a blue marble bathing in the rays of the sun. 

Dev remembered the first time he had seen Gaia rise through his own eyes. At that moment, before he realized it, his mind, drunk on nostalgia, stumbled down into the dusty corridors of memory. Dev excused himself from the gathering, retreated to his quarters and retrieved Rejog’s manuscript. He hadn’t read it since the night Rejog died; more than a decade had whizzed by. He turned to what he remembered was his favourite verse of The Ghost Orchid. A meditation on why poetry is necessary for the human soul, Rejog’s narrator suggests that writing poetry isn’t meant as an act of purging one’s unhappy memories, but rather to allow the unhappiness to become the soil in which the seeds of poetry would be sown; catharsis, like gardening, was only possible by getting your hands dirty.  He wondered then to himself: Is that what I have done, by coming and volunteering to live on the moon? Did I come here so that I can sow seeds of my misery into my poetry in complete solitude?  

Outside, the two week-long lunar night descended over the nearside of the moon.  The Sabine Crater enclosure was abandoned today. There’d be no rush of wealthy pilgrims from Mirage seeking spiritual cleansing at the lunar abode of Mother Mirage. Nothing stirred in his line of vision. 

Dev turned back and stepped into the corridor that led to the inner sanctum of the temple. He had minimal duties to attend to today so he chose to have an early meal. The kitchen was dark, but the lights came on as soon as he stepped in. 

<Hello, Dev>, a stoic voice greeted him from the tiny speaker behind the kitchen counter. <Do you need any assistance?>

Hello, OVI. Yes. I thought I would have an early meal and go to bed. 

<Would you like anything in particular, Dev?> 

Soup please, thank you. 

<Yes, Dev. Your meal will be ready in five minutes.>

Thank you, OVI. 

Dev took his usual seat at the counter and gestured for the embedded screen to wake up. 

<Library accessed. Do you want to load last opened book?> 

Yes. 

Barely a second passed before the system loaded the book he had purchased, opening it at the exact line Dev’s eyes had comprehended last.

<Nomad: The Eternal Journey of the Dom People, BY ANAKA-ODONATA ZIROMT, Pg 3>  
　　　　INTRODUCTION 
　　　　
I am a traveller, not a writer. It is a strange admission, certainly unworthy first words of a book; stranger when you consider that these are the words of someone who was raised by a writer and a librarian. It is important, then, I tell you why I wrote this at all, and to do so I must tell you a story. 

My grandfather, the late Rejog C Rackel, dreamt of building a library all his life. It would be, he announced to my mother who was little over ten years old then, the largest in the world, one that would be devoted to the ruthless acquisition, comprehension and dissemination of all knowledge as it was being acquired, comprehended and disseminated by those who had acquired, comprehended and disseminated that knowledge on their various fields of study. He reasoned that by reconciling all knowledge – the totality of insights from our sciences, our humanities, our arts – would lead us to the fundamental truths of all life: nothing less than why it is we are here, how it is we got here, where it is we are headed, and how it is that we can wonder about all of these things at all. 

My grandfather hailed from a wealthy and influential family, yes, but it was his academic background that gained the attention of the politicians of his time. To them he proposed the idea of this grand library of all knowledge. They laughed until realization dawned that my grandfather wasn’t joking. 

Over the next two decades he expounded on the idea in his weekly column on The Miragian, at times going as far as to explicitly ask for support from his legion of devoted readers; among them was former President Jaruna Abey. The then Minister Abey paid a visit to my grandfather and on that evening a deal was struck: in exchange for my grandfather’s support for Minister Abey in the upcoming Presidential race he was promised a cabinet posting at the Ministry of Education, and, most importantly, a budget allocation for his pet project. 

What we know through the pages of history is that Abey won the elections and kept to his promise. My grandfather was given the approval to go ahead with the building of the library. As you may have gathered by now my grandfather was a man of obsessions – he poured himself into every aspect of the new library’s work. He chaired all meeting with architects and city planners. He spent nights awake pouring over proposals for the design of the library. It was during this period he realized his eyesight was failing him. In five years, at the age of 55, as The Miragian National Library neared completion, he would be almost completely blind. He hadn’t learnt Braille and never read another word again.  

It isn’t my intention to dispute the pages of history. Nor am I insinuating that credit for the building of the library wasn’t give to the man who originally dreamt of it and pursued it until he was completely blind; my grandfather realized before anyone that only a politician’s interest could help this mad (some derided the project as being too idealistic) dream come to fruition, and he was happy for any politician to get the plaudits – and the votes – as long as he got his dear library built. 

With that achieved, my grandfather resigned from his post in the Ministry and became the first director of The Miragian National Library. Years went by but he continued going to the library every day until the last months of his life. I accompanied him to the library every afternoon after school. My task was simple: I was to be his reader. He suggested books that I ought to read just so he could hear the music of the words that had enraptured him as a child. This went on for over 10 years – on hindsight, a better education I couldn’t have asked for – and one afternoon as I read to him the travel diaries of Isa Fonceka, the famed [delete]travel writer and anthropologist, he sighed aloud. He was glum. ‘Ana’, his voice morose: ‘I haven’t seen enough of the world. I was foolish then and blind now, but learn from me, little one. I hope you will see more of the world than I ever did.’ 

Those words haunt me every day like the ghostly melody of a favourite song stuck in the head. And like the lyrics of any timeless song, his words have evolved in their meaning to me as I have grown older. I now see his urge for me to see the world through my own eyes as a plea to walk away from the vicarious nature of our acquisition of knowledge. This is truer now than ever before in human history. We no longer have to devote entire buildings for the acquisition, comprehension and dissemination of knowledge. We send robots to the harshest landscapes in our world to acquire knowledge on our behalves. In our pockets are handheld devices that allow us to acquire possibly all of human knowledge just by asking our OVIs the right questions. But here is a question your OVI device might not be able to answer: is knowledge gained in increasingly vicarious ways knowledge at all, or is it merely trivia? I don’t pretend to have the answer. 

This book is about a people who don’t subscribe to acquiring knowledge vicariously; indeed, they actively display disdain towards the written tradition: theirs is an oral culture. The Dom people don’t claim a special understanding of the universe, they have no Gods, they have no prophets, no central political leadership, and they don’t even have a homeland. Yet I knew within a week of meeting them for the first time that my fate and theirs would be intertwined when an elderly matriarch of the tribe told me, ‘We don’t have libraries and wise men, but our memories are good and our memories are our own.’ Six nights later, under the April full moon, I abandoned my studies, packed a small bag, and began a nomadic life with the Dom people. 

This book, based on my daily diary entries over the four years I spent crossing Pangaea with the Dom people, is my attempt to tell their story; for now, more than ever in their history of ceaseless persecution by supposedly civilized nations and peoples, their story needs to be heard.

The Thar Desert is a harsh place to witness the beginning of anything. The desert, over four times as large as the land area of Mirage, is at first sight a desolate, sandy wasteland cloaked from the eyes of human civilization for eons by a salt marsh towards its southern borders, the mighty Indói River, which runs parallel to The Thar’s western edge, and the Arvalli Range in the east. But it is here the story of Mirage began and, perhaps aptly, it is here the story of my journey with the Dom people began.  
Towards the end of my graduate studies I had an opportunity to be part of an anthropological survey into the world’s nomadic people. I have always been fascinated by the Dom population and, as chance would have it, they were the first of our sample groups. The research team, led by Professor A M Novakhazi, left to Sikar, a hamlet that sits at The Thar’s north-eastern boundary. It is the final outpost of human civilization inside Circardia’s borders. The Dom people, numbering in their tens of thousands, gather here for their biennium mass pilgrimage; what they colloquially refer to as ‘a walk in the garden’. This ‘walk in the garden’ will see them re-enact the most revered journey of their ancestors who braved The Thar to reach the river banks of the Indói, from which they ventured into The Raan of Kachchh and emerged out to the town of Nadiad in the South; from Nadiad they’d continue walking, nestled by the Ghats parallel to the Western most borders of Circadia, for a further 1200 miles until they reach the shores of Lake Circadia. This is the end of the pilgrimage. The massive murmaration of people then dissipate back their separate ways, but never to a homeland for they have none (that phrase ‘their separate ways’, which we use so casually, is completely redefined by the Dom people). No Dom dares cross the waters of Lake Circadia and reach the opposite shore that is ten miles away, but Dom folklore tells of the only instance in this five thousand year tradition of ‘the walk in the garden’ when a large group of Dom decided to cross the lake and see what lay beyond the palm trees on the opposite shores. They never came back. 
The Dom, unlike the early Miragians, didn’t write down their history. What we have on their origins is passed down for eons through oral story-telling. In this dearth of reliable texts, we are left with two approaches to identifying the relationship between the Dom people and Miragians over millennia: a linguistic route and a genetic route. 
The first requires only you understanding the Miragian tongue. The story I related above wasn’t told to me; rather it was the elderly matriarch relating it to Professor Novakhazi in the Domian language. To my surprise, I found I understood (I devote an entire section to the similarities between the Miragian and Domian languages so I will not spend too much time on the topic here) and even words that were foreign I could guess their meaning in context, and more often than not found that I was correct. 
A more empirical approach was explored by a group of geneticists, and their findings published in the Miragian Journal of Genetics. This seminal paper confirmed what most anthropologists and linguists had long suspected: Miragians and the Dom share a common ancestry. The evidence is, quite literally, in our blood. Further corroboration came when archaeological evidence of primitive tools found on the Miragian shores of Lake Circadia suggested that the first Miragians settled on its shores around 3,500 years ago, around the time, Dom folklore tells us, the group splintered into two.
So, what caused the one instance of the splintering? What possessed a possibly sizeable group within a very nomadic people to look at the Miragian shores about ten miles across a vast lake and convince themselves that it could be a home for eternity?
Since science has not given us answers yet, I will defer to an extraordinarily passionate response from the elderly matriarch when I asked her this question. ‘You Miragian?’ She asked me, cutting me off midpoint. I nodded. ‘I see fear of death. It is in your eyes. Like all Miragians. Like first Miragians. They left us, crossed the water because they afraid land eventually kill us all. They feared future. Dom doesn’t fear future. For the Dom, only the now. There was a now. There is a now. There will be a now. When we look back at yesterdays’ nows, we look back because we want to tell our children and our grandchildren stories of our many nows that touched us. To look forward to the nows of tomorrow is foolish – there are no stories in the future until the future becomes a now.’ she paused and with a mischievous glint added:  ‘To look forward is Miragian.’

						II
The week spent in Sikar passed quickly. During the day we interviewed as many of the Dom as we could, but their numbers swelled far quicker than our research team could cope with; Professor Novakhazi estimated around 45,000 had gathered in three days. 
The Dom move in small tribes of roughly one hundred members, each named after a Matriarch from the past. For instance, the matriarch who we befriended was from the Štar clan, and she herself was called Štar after the Great Mother who, according to folklore, was the virgin mother of septuplets, four sons and three daughters, whose inter-breeding gave birth to the clan five hundred years ago. 
As the moon grew larger with every passing night, I found it harder to come to terms with leaving them and going back to the comforts of my life in Circadia, back to study halls and insufferable social obligations that I had as the daughter of a diplomat. On Full Moon’s eve, the Dom, by now numbering an estimated one hundred thousand, had gathered. After the full moon was sighted, the Dom would celebrate.  Štar invited us to join them. We went around 9 and the celebrations were in full swing. 
Štar’s caravan was cloaked behind great plumes of smoke. I heard her loud laughter come from inside. I entered, not realizing Professor Novakhazi and my companions were mixing with the other members of the Štar clan. ‘Ahh, Miragian girl. You came’, I looked around. There was no one else in the caravan. Štar was laughing all by herself. 
‘Yes, Štar. I came. Thank you for having us.’ 
‘Sit’, she beckoned me closer. ‘Pretty eyes, girl. What they call you?’ 
‘Anaka’ 
‘The All-Seeing one. Old Miragian name.’
‘Yes’
‘Are you All-Seeing, girl?’ 
I couldn’t help but laugh. ‘No. Sometimes I can’t see what’s in front of me.’ 
‘Do you know how I became Matriarch of clan?’ 
‘No, you never told us.’ 
‘Matriarch of a Dom clan is one who walk away from tragedy with rare gift. The first Štar thrown out by father, she was with child. She starve, no shelter from harsh sunny days, and cold nights, but she survive, and for her trouble she was given a gift: not with one, but seven children fathered by some unknown spirit. Me, I watched them burn my caravan down, my family inside. I spent days wishing that they had killed me too, but no. 
‘Who burnt down the caravan?’
‘They.’
I decided to not press her on the point. There was a long period of silence. I thought I could see the faint glimmer of a tear rolling out of her eyes. 
‘My fate different, girl’, She said, breaking the silence. ‘My fate different. I became eye-reader. That is why I am the Matriarch of this clan. I see fears, hopes, lies, memories that hide in the eyes of man, woman and child, Dom, Miragian or Circadian.’ She paused again and looked me in the eye. ‘I read yours.’ 
‘You said I had the fear of death in my eyes, like all Miragians.’ 
‘You understand when I say ‘fear’? 
‘No’ 
‘Yes, you do. Lies.’ 
I hesitated. ‘Yes, I do’ 
‘Tell.’
The music outside was getting louder and more rambunctious. Inside the caravan, the smoke got thicker. ‘I am afraid I won’t have enough time to see all of Gaia.’ 
Štar had the beatific smile we associate with hermits – and yet she was anything but. ‘Inside you, girl, is fight between blood; between Dom and Miragian. You fear Miragian win.’ 
The thought had run through my mind, but I had dismissed it. ‘You’re wrong’, I protested. 
‘Lies.’
I didn’t respond. 
‘Something else I see in your eyes.’
‘Tell me’, my voice was brittle. 
‘The dragonfly inside’, she whispered into my ears. ‘Let her fly, girl.’

　　　　III
Later that night, I sat at the table by my bed at the Sikar lodge and wrote the following note to my parents: 
	Dear Mama and Papa, 
This is a difficult note to write but I urge you to read it in the full knowledge that I’ve taken this decision for the sake of my happiness. I’ve decided to join a nomadic clan in their annual pilgrimage. At dawn we will set off from Sikar and head towards Lake Circadia. I’ve been told that the journey will last six full moons. Please understand that I need this. There is so much to learn from them, so much for them to show me. I need this more than all the hours I will spend in study halls studying about these very people.
You can expect to see me towards the end of the year, safe and sound.
	I will miss you. 
	All my love, 
	Yours,
	Ana 
I knocked on Professor Novakhazi’s door when the sound of the crows could be heard outside my window. He opened the door, bleary-eyed. 
‘I am sorry to wake you up so early, Professor Novakhazi.’
‘That’s alright. What’s the matter, Ziromt?’ 
‘I am leaving with the Štars’, I handed him the note I had written for my parents. ‘I am going on the walk in the garden, Professor.’ 
He sighed, but showed very little surprise. ‘You think this note will somehow placate your parents?’ 
‘No’
‘Your father will be apoplectic.’ 
‘Yes’ 
‘I am responsible for you lot, you know?’ 
‘Yes. But you also know that I have thought this through and that I will be safe under Štar’s care. If you didn’t, you would be angry right now.’ He shook his head. 
‘You are difficult, Ziromt, irritating too, but I will miss you in my lecture halls.’
‘I’ll be back’, I hugged him. ‘And don’t worry about my parents. They know my stubborn streak well enough to know that you had no chance to change my mind.’ 
‘Goodbye, Ana. Old Rejog, he’d be proud.’ 
I waved and turned towards the stairs. 
The town was about a kilometre away from the Dom settlements. I ran towards it as the sound of conch shells grew louder. Each clan had a shell that was passed down from generation to generation, some conchs as old as 300 years old, each singing a tune that specifically called for its clan members to gather as one. I listened for the Štar theme. It is a brief melody, using a mere three notes, but its’ distinctive airiness had already engrained itself in my mind. Running through crowded grounds filled with children playing games, past recent campfires, overtaking caravans, I finally made it to the Štars. They had gathered around Štar when I interrupted, out of breadth and hunched on my knees. 
I felt countless eyes on me. 
Štar laughed. One by one her clan joined her and very soon so did I, still breathing heavily from the running. 
‘You come, girl. Again.’
‘Yes’, I managed to say. ‘I want to walk in the garden with you.’
The laughter subsided. A little girl seated on Štar’s lap got off and walked towards me. She offered her hand. I took it and crouched so her eyes and mine met. 
‘Me Di’, the little girl said. ‘What do call, sister?’ 
‘She’, Štar interjected from behind with smoke blowing out her mouth, ‘Dragonfly.’

His couldn’t feel his feet, but something was underneath his bed sheet. He could smell it. Where is the light? The light?! The fucking light? His hands stumbled and found the switch for the night lamp. He turned it on. The bed sheet rippled. Snakes? Fuck. Shit. He pulled the sheets back while bracing his shoulders, arms and torso so that he could yank himself out of the bed with force. But his legs wouldn’t move while his eyes surveyed the nightmare underneath his sheets. Countless maggots, aroused by the aroma of man flesh, were congregating on his heavily wounded left leg.  Rotting flesh clung to broken bone. Screaming, unable to still move the lower half of his body, he tried using his hands to push away the worms. 
‘Major Mahasen, wake up. Major Mahasen. Wake up.’ 
Opening his panic-stricken eyes, Hasyl was confronted by the look of concern on the man’s face. 
‘Are you alright, Major Mahasen? You were having a bad dream I think.’ 
‘Where am I?’
‘You are in a military hospital, Major Mahasen. You are safe.’ 
‘How did I get here?’ 
‘You don’t remember much of yesterday?’ 
‘I remember getting out of the car. Everything else is a blank.’
‘That’s normal. Your memories will come back soon.’
‘Wait...I remember you, Doctor.’ 
‘There…you see, you are starting to remember already.’ 
‘I apologize for my behaviour last night, Doctor...Doctor?’
‘Dr. Tarun Abey.’
‘Dr. Abey I am truly sorry about –‘
‘- that’s quite alright, Major Mahasen. You were suffering from trauma. It’s natural to be emotional, even angry.’ 
‘You saved my life. Thank you.’ 
‘Don’t mention it. Now about those nightmares?’ 
‘I’ve had nightmares before, but nothing out of the ordinary. Not like this.’ 
 ‘It is possibly because of what you went through. And you are on painkillers. I wouldn’t worry. You’ll get better soon’, he was reading real-time vitals on his OVI device. ‘Judging by this, I’d say you are in a stable condition. I will check on you in the evening. Get plenty of rest. Good day.’ He turned to leave. 
‘Dr Abey?’
‘Yes, Major’
‘I still feel an itch there, where my left leg was. Is that normal?’
‘The itch or twitching you feel around the stump are the nerve-endings - these communicate your sense of touch. Right now, that particular area of the leg’s nerve-endings are reorganizing themselves post-amputation, Major. It is uncomfortable, I understand, but it is normal.  Give it time. You’ll be fine.’ 
‘Thank you, Doctor.’ 
‘Pleasure. Now remember: Get some rest. I’ll pass news of your recovery. Your father will be a relieved man.’ 
　　　　*** 
Ohiy woke to the familiar jangle of the bell. Ella was awake. Ohiy sighed. Her friend had become difficult, even childlike, in her behaviour during the last few years. Was it the fate of the terminally-ill-and-bed-ridden to relieve their infant years as they approach death and their memories evaporate, she wondered. Will it be my fate? And if so, who will humour my descent into this last infantilism? She put the thought aside. There was work to be done. She braced herself against the walking stick and called on all her strength to stand up. 
Jara had insisted Ohiy move to his room after he moved to Ironwood Trees <the official residency of The President of Mirage> so that she didn’t have to walk from the other end of the house to attend to Ella. Now that their rooms were on opposite sides of the corridor, Ella seemed to call Ohiy more frequently, insisting that the attending nurse had wronged her. Ohiy realized over the years that it was Ella’s way of gaining attention. Most of the nurses never stayed long though; the apparent bragging rights among the nurse [nurse community ]community of being the caretaker of the president’s mother giving away to the pragmatic reality of a moody old woman who crowed and complained about everything, including, in some cases, their appearances. But the current nurse, Floa, had persevered by not taking Ella’s ranting personally. 
She opened the door and was immediately puzzled. 
‘Am I to die alone?’ there was indignation in Ella’s voice. 
‘Where is Floa?’
‘Am I to die –‘
‘- the nurse, Ella. Where is the nurse?’
‘ – I don’t know. Am I to die alone?’ 
‘Don’t be silly, Ella. You’ll drag me to the afterlife with that silly bell of yours’, Ohiy waved her hand dismissing the question. She walked towards the screen and touched the button. 
A male voice from the other end: ‘Kitchen here.’
‘Is Floa down there?’ 
‘Haven’t seen her, Miss Ohiy. Do you need anything?’
‘Send the orderlies in first. I need help giving madam a bath. And ask Floa to come see me if you meet her.’ 
‘Will do, Miss Ohiy.’ 
The orderlies came a few minutes later and helped Ohiy in bathing and getting Ella ready. After getting her dressed, Ohiy sat by Ella’s side and took both their medicine boxes out. She counted Ella’s pills and then her own. ‘Here’, she handed, ‘a few decades ago I was dealing you cards. Us in that tiny cell. You a frail little child locked in prison with angry old me. Do you remember?’ Ella remained silent. ‘Now all I have is pills, El.’ She paid Ohiy no attention. ‘Listen, woman. I too have to take my medicine. And I am older than you, and therefore more likely to die if I don’t.’ 
Ella relented. She poked out her hand. Ohiy handed her the medicine one by one, patiently waiting for Ella to gulp each pill down. ‘Good girl’, she patted Ella after it was done. ‘Now my turn.’ 
<INCOMING CALL>, an electronic voice interrupted, startling Ohiy. <Mahasen, Hasyl. Accept call?>
‘Yes, yes’, Ohiy replied. She hated that artificial voice. 
‘Good morning, Miss Ohiy. How are we today?’ Hasyl sounded happy.  
‘Good morning, Hasyl. Your grandmother is annoyed, but that is not unusual.’
‘Great, great. I’ll be there in half an hour’, he paused. ‘I am looking forward to today. It’s been a while.’ 
‘Your father is a busy man, Hasyl. You know that very well.’
‘Still. It’s been awhile since we sat down as a family and shared a meal. I miss that.’ Ohiy smiled to herself: the boy had changed so much - and for the better - in the last few years. ‘I also have news. I have an announcement to make, Miss Ohiy.’ 
‘Oh? What’s that?’ 
‘It’s a surprise. Be patient. I’ll be there soon’, he ended the call. 
						***
‘These men, your brothers in arms, were shot. In cold blood’, the fat man paused. He was sweating. ‘Like animals. We can’t let that pass!’
‘No!’ Someone in the crowd shouted. 
‘We can’t pretend this didn’t happen!’ the politician’s voice grew louder. 
‘No’, more voices in the crowd. 
‘They ask. And they ask. Forever, they ask for more. And today they kill our brothers and ask us What are you going to do about it? They took the lives of men. Men just like you. Husbands. Fathers. Brothers. Soldiers. Samnian men. Patriots. By Mother Mirage, they were patriots!’ 
The crowd roared. 	
‘And for them, in their memory, we will answer the question these traitors asked us today. Today we give them our answer. This is what we will do to those who ask to divide Mother’s bounty. This is what we will do to traitors and terrorists. This is what we will do to those who harm our brothers!’ 
The collective roar for bloodlust shook Hasyl. He strode towards the stage. ‘Minister’, he whispered into the fat man’s ears. ‘May I have a word? In private, sir. Please’, Hasyl’s voice was insistent. 
The minister signalled his entourage to disperse. The crowd was still roaring. 
‘Well?’
‘That was unnecessarily provocative, Minister.’
‘Are you trying to tell me –‘
‘I don’t mean to tell you how to your job, sir but you are making my job harder. You’ve just provoked my unit to avenge the death of their comrades in a town where their only job is to keep things quiet and calm.’
‘Pfft. They’ll have a few drinks, go into town and slap a few of those savages around. Nothing to worry about.’ 
‘Either you are an idiot – or a cold-blooded monster. I don’t know - which one is it?’
‘I’d be very careful with the words I use if I were you, Major. Just because your fa -’
‘ - Oh I choose my words very carefully, Minister. If there is bloodshed tonight, we will lose the support of the entire Shivaputra population in Mirage. If there is bloodshed tonight you would have achieved in ten minutes what the separatists have been desperately trying to do for the past decade - you give their cause credibility. If there is bloodshed tonight, I will hold you personally responsible. If there is bloodshed tonight, I will see that you rot.’
‘So’, the minister gave a toothy smile, ‘this is why daddy doesn’t want you in politics.’ He walked away before Hasyl could retort. The crowd was dispersing but Hasyl knew where the soldiers were headed. 
A gun shot. A screamed threat. Another roar. 
Hasyl ran in the direction of the frenzied mob. Outside the camp, it was no longer just his men. In their midst were a group of the politician’s henchmen. The mob was making its way down the road to the Naffaj Public Library. Hasyl pursued the crowd in his jeep, but found himself unable to take the vehicle beyond a certain point. He shouted for them to halt, but was drowned out in the cacophony of hate. He fired his weapon in the air, but that did little to get the crowd’s attention. They continued marching, shouting slogans. Death to the traitorous animals! Death to them all! 
Hasyl got out of the jeep and dived into the crowd, forcing his way to the head of the mob. ‘Stop right now’, Hasyl shouted to the soldiers streaming past him. ‘That is a direct order!’ None paid attention. The continued marching past him, some even jostling him aside.  Hasyl continued pushing forward until he could see the library’s facade dominating the horizon. 
The mob stopped. In front of the gates of the library was another group, smaller and civilian. 
‘Samanian men have died today’, the man at the head of the mob announced towards the group guarding the gate, ‘many Shivas will pay!’ he barked. 
An old man stepped forward. ‘Please’, the old man put his hands up and walked towards the mob in slow measured steps. ‘Please’, he repeated. ‘There is no need for this. Let’s sit and discuss this like rational men.’
Hasyl, pushing his way through the crowd, could hear the bark clearly, ‘Three of ours died tonight because of your scum youth!’ 
‘And we will see they are tried for their crimes. We have them in captivity. Together we will ensure that they face the full wrath of the law for their crimes, but, brothers please, there is no need for mob justice.’ 
‘Who are you supposed to be?’ another voice snapped.
‘I am the caretaker of this library, but I speak for all of us Shivaputras in this town right now. Let us remember we are all countrymen –‘
The first voice laughed and the rest of the mob joined. ‘Fine joke’, the voice barked. ‘One moment you fuckers want a separate country but the moment you are about to get canned you are suddenly a bloody patriot.’ 
‘But I don’t want a separate country, brother’, the old man protested. 
Hasyl found himself increasingly unable to push through the thronging crowd. 
‘What do you want then?’ 
‘I want to see all Miragian faiths to have equally footing, brother. But above all I want to make sure there is no bloodshed – tonight or any night.’ 
‘You said you have the men who killed our brothers. Where are they?’ 
‘They are in our custody’, the old man replied. 
‘Give them to us’, the voice demanded. 
‘Brother, please. You are angry. Taking custody of the men suspected of killing is not your responsibility. It is that of the law.’ 
‘Listen, I am not interested in a civics lesson, old man. Give us the men and there won’t be any more problems from us. Refuse and we will find them in any way we can.’ 
Hasyl finally emerged from the throng: ‘What do you think you are doing?’ 
A bald man eyed Hasyl. ‘Who let him here?’ he snapped at the men standing behind him.  It was his voice Hasyl had heard threatening the civilians. Hasyl walked up to the man. ‘You are one of the minister’s dogs, aren’t you?’ 
‘I bite if you come too close.’
Hasyl stepped even closer, ‘Call off your men.’
‘My men are just a handful. The rest are yours. You call them off.’ 
Hasyl stepped away from the man and faced his soldiers. ‘You are soldiers of the United Tribes of Mirage. And I am your commanding officer. I order you to return to camp immediately. Failure to do so, and I will see every one of you court-martialled. Do I make myself clear?’ 
Their eyes still burnt. Not one soldier moved. 
‘What does it feel like to lose command, Major?’ the bald man teased. ‘That must make you useless – even to other faggots.’ Hasyl’s attempt at a punch merely grazed the bald man’s chin. His riposte, a vicious elbow, sent Hasyl to the ground. 
‘Touch me again’, the bald man climbed on Hasyl’s fallen body, yanked his collar and shook Hasyl like a rag doll. ‘Touch me again and I will rearrange your face. I don’t give a shit who your daddy is. Do we understand one another?’ his face loomed over Hasyl’s. Blood gushing down his shattered nose and into his mouth, Hasyl nodded. The bald man patted his cheeks. ‘That’s a good prince. Now don’t move. Don’t say a fucking word. Men at work, you see.’ 
He stood and motioned for the old man to come forward. ‘As you can see, I am running out of patience. I will ask once more: Where are those men?’  
The old man’s voice shook as he gathered himself. ‘Brother, you aren’t an officer of the –‘ 
His body dropped; the old man’s face shattered from the gunshot. The bald one walked closer and emptied his gun on the old man’s lifeless body. ‘Here lies a traitorous scum, brothers’, his voice was lowered, ‘Let’s find some more!’ and roared again. 
The group that had been guarding the gate scattered as the mob gave them chase. A young boy who tried escaping several times was pinned down while the mob pounded his kneecaps. A woman was stripped of her clothes, her hands tied to the metal bars of the library’s gate while some of the mob took turns to rape her.  Others dispersed in several directions. In the distance he could hear gunfire and see smoke billowing. Hasyl didn’t know how much time passed before the rest of the mob returned. He continued lying on the ground, his head in a puddle of mud, unsure if it was his impotence or the bald man that frightened him. 
They returned having evidently apprehended the men suspected of killing the soldiers. A chant Burn them! Burn the traitors! Burn the murderers!  was working its way to crescendo. When it did, as if on cue, some of the mob came bearing rubber tyres. The three suspects were beaten and adorned in necklaces of tyres while they pleaded for mercy. The bald man stepped forward, poured kerosene over the men and lit the fires. Hasyl thought he saw the bald man sporting a faint smile as the three men burnt and tormented screams pierced from their infernos. 
The mob then entered the library. Hasyl heard the breaking of glass, the toppling of book shelves. He saw the busts of writers bursting out of windows as the mob sought to destroy every vestige of the library’s spirit. Their work done, they filed out of the building and sat down and admired their work as the library burnt all night.

<Our objective in publishing this special report with a focus on the events of 23rd July 2623 is to highlight the efforts of this government at enforcing social amnesia. That: i) the acts of genocide are a two-pronged strategy, one manifested in exercising brute force against a section of the population, the other in the form of a gradual defacing, and eventual destruction, of the other side’s cultural pillars. Seen against this light the burning of the library wasn’t - as one of the government’s more hawkish ministers dismissively claimed - ‘a few louts getting drunk and getting carried away’, but instead a systemic tactic employed by governments facing secession claims to erase the secessionists’ sense of identity, its sense of self – in effect, sowing the seeds of social amnesia among the secessionists by destroying those pillars they give rise to group consciousness in the first place; and ii) the climate of repression and censorship that looms over Mirage’s Forth Estate can no longer be dismissed as necessary in the interest of national security. The only reason a society refuses the tireless pursuit of political and historical truth is, we can only assume, for the same reason a man whose face is horribly scarred refuses to look at himself in the mirror. 
In monitoring the daily news sources following the burning of the library, we were depressed, but not surprised, when the event went unreported for a whole week. Then on the 31st of July, under an unremarkable headline, The Miragian claimed the library had reported a small fire that was soon put out. It also claimed negligence as the cause. 
It is startlingly clear the aims of the government in this regard: it isn’t merely to make us forget such events, but to forget what it is we forgot at all.

Jara closed the report and rubbed his eyes. This aversion to sleep had to stop. But how? He contemplated seeking medical advice, but then a new fear appeared: what if my enemies get to know? What if there was a loud-mouthed idiot in my office who, in pillow talk with his wife or mistress, were to blurt it all out? There would be no stopping the rumour mill. It will reach the rats and they will use it to dispose of me from office. I can see the headlines now. No. I will have enough problems once this NTHR report goes public. What then? He wondered. Perhaps seek out Ohiy for advice when the family dropped in for breakfast later that day. He made a mental note as he opened the door to his study. In the corridor, the security detail was asleep, but instinct kicked in as soon as they were bathed in the light from Jara’s study. There was a brief look of terror in their faces. Jara motioned for them to relax. 
‘Your Excellency, is everything alright?’
‘Fine, fine’, Jara assured them. ‘I am hungry.’
They reached for their radios, ‘We’ll notify the kitchen staff to prepare you a meal.’
Jara cut them off. ‘I feel like making myself something. Don’t wake anyone up’, he continued walking past them. The Presidential Security Division were scattered all over the house, but particularly near windows and doors. As he made his way down the staircase, past the portraits of past presidents, to the east wing where the kitchen was located, he had to explain what he was doing. Jara resorted to having a finger over his lips and mouthing ‘shush’ at every encounter with a PSD agent. He realized he might look silly, but was too peckish to bother correcting himself. Finally reaching the entrance to the kitchen, he could hear voices from inside. 
‘...she sucked me off good, brother. Let me tell ye, Circadian women love my co… ’
Jara opened the door and saw two confused men. One had been munching away at a sandwich, his mouth now full. The other, evidently the teller of the sordid anecdote, was holding a bottle of beer. He waved them off before they could blabber apologies to him. ‘What is that?’ he asked pointing at the first one’s plate. He was frantically digesting the food in his mouth and unable to still talk. Jara turned his attention to the other agent. 
‘Erm...I think it is a beef sandwich’, he looked at his companion for confirmation – the sandwich-eater nodded, ‘Yes, it is a beef sandwich, Your Excellency.’
‘May I eat it? ‘, Jara looked in the direction of the sandwich eater. Gulping his food down, frantically nodding, he managed to say, ’Yes, yes, Your Excellency.’
Jara took the plate with the uneaten half of the sandwich. He looked at the beer drinker. ’You have more of those?’ The agent opened the refrigerator door and grabbed a bottle of beer.  ’I’ll have three.’ The agent handed Jara three bottles. 
Jara opened the first bottle. ’Continue with your story. I believe, you were at the part about Circadian women and their love for your cock. Cheers’, he toasted and turned back as the embarrassed agent raised his bottle in turn. 
He was drunk an hour later as the sun rose over the eastern sky. He had finished reading the NTHR report in the interim and even though he knew its contents would blight the rest of his political career, he chose instead to reflect, as drunken men do, on the meaning of the sunrise over the landscape of his being on a day when life turns, for better or for worse: does the sunrise on such days herald the promise of the impending fortune or doom? All he saw was the same orange hue meeting the faint blue of sky. No message was written in the heavens. He lumbered back to his table. How I wish I could sleep right now. He sat on his seat and threw away the report which knocked a picture frame off his table. It landed softly on the carpet. He crawled towards it. The frame laid face first on the carpet. He turned it around knowing which photo it held in place. Was this why Manal was so drawn to photography, he wondered, because it froze moments so perfectly, making them impervious to the ravages of emotion and change?  
What happened to that boy? He still remembered the year of the photograph as the time Manal walked in and coolly put forward his case. ’And why this sudden urge to study, much less study in Circadia?’, Jara had asked him when it was done. ’Because they are the centre of a global cultural revolution, father. Science, technology, art – those Circadians are changing the very way we live. I want to learn from them and then come back here to help you take Mirage closer to your vision’, Manal had delivered his rehearsed lie to perfection. 
Jara thought long before he decided to allow Manal to study in Circadia. ’One day’, Jara began as father and son said their goodbyes to one another at the airport, ’When I am no longer president, I hope my sons will each lead. That includes you too, Manal.’
’I know, father’, Manal replied. 
’You will come back… ’, Jara’s voice trailed off, unsure if it was a question or a stern reminder he wished to articulate. 
’I will come back’, Manal asserted. After that lie, he was lost to sex, to drugs and to that monstrosity he called music. He even remembered the stupid name of the band Manal had joined in Circadia: Anthems for Doomed Youth. 
<Anthems for Doomed Youth was a Circadian heavy metal band best known for their sophomore album On The Natural History of Destruction. With its existential cynicism and apparent joy at the idea of impending destruction, brought to life by Manal’s lyrics and insane vocal delivery <note: not singing>, its success caught everyone, including the band themselves, by surprise. Pop culture experts debated for long on how such a band could have broken out in a musical landscape that was dominated by crooning auto-tuned voices serenading those who they loved or lusted after. The dominant view, put forward by prominent philosopher and musicologist Garb Lamrec, was that it was the music that best captured the upheaval – technological, social, psychological – of the times: ’We live in a world where the word ’disrupt’ is bandied about as a badge of honour. It is an overhauling, a clearing of the cobwebs, a sometimes necessary act of purging the old and welcoming the new. The music of AoDY best captured this spirit and possibly resonated with the youthful innovators of the time. Here was music that spoke to these influential young men and women who viewed themselves as natural successors of the enlightenment era two hundred years before, who viewed their destinies as nothing less than heralding in a new renaissance. ’>    
Jara shifted his focus to Dev. Thirteen years old he was then but the aloofness in his eyes, a trait that he had since he was a child – completely incompatible within a political realm – was captured by the photographer, this man who had only walked into the room five minutes before and left five minutes after. Try as he might, Jara couldn’t recall a moment when the thought of Dev hadn’t filled his mind with some degree of disquiet.  My problem child. I only lost control of Manal in his mid-twenties, but you, you Dev, you were always the troublemaker. Right from the start. ’Do you have any fucking idea’, Jara had screamed at Dev the night of his first term inauguration, ’how stupid I look when one of my own children doesn’t come for my inauguration? Do you? ’ Dev remained quiet. ’Tell me then, why? Why? Because of that Ziromt girl? You fool! Did anyone recognize you at the airport?’ Dev shook his head. ’Are you sure?’ Jara asked again. Dev continued shaking his head. ’Then what is this?’ Jara pulled out the grainy photo and threw it at Dev’s face. It showed Dev embracing Ana in the airport, in the background a vision screen showing Jara taking his oaths. ’The only reason this won’t be on tomorrow’s papers is because the editors were kind enough to let this pass. Do you have any idea how embarrassing it would look for me? Of course you don’t! You don’t give a shit about anyone except yourself.  Here I am, taking my oaths as President of the United Tribes of Mirage while my son is busy with some –’
’Father’, Dev interjected. ’I am your son. You can scold me as much as you like and I will stand here and take it, but you won’t drag Ana’s name into this.’ Still seething at the boy’s indifference to family, Jara reacted to Dev’s new found defiance by slapping across his cheek. And then he ran away to that mad hermit in the mountain.
<INCOMING CALL>, the electronic voice of his private OVI announced. <General Facēnos. Accept call?>
’Yes’, Jara replied still spread-eagled on the floor. 
’Good morning, Mr President. I am sorry to be calling you so early.’
’That’s quite alright. I’ve been awake for a while now, General. What is it?’
‘Major Mahasen paid me a visit last night. He was...’
’Go on.’
’He wants to resign from his commission, Your Excellency.’
’Did he say why?’
’With all due respect, sir, it is fairly obvious why he wants to retire.’
’By all means then, General, enlighten me.’
’Your Excellency, Major Mahasen has been under tremendous strain since the events in Naffaj last year. You know this very well. He’s clearly stressed and wants to put the episode behind him. He thinks retiring from the army will help that process.’
’Are you telling me, General, that you accepted my son’s suggestion without my approval?’
’I wouldn’t be calling you if I did, sir.’
’Good. I am expecting Hasyl. We have a family breakfast later. I will talk him out of it.’
’Very good, Your Excellency.’
’Thank you, General. Anything else?’
The General cleared his throat. Clearly the next topic was even more awkward than the first. ’You asked me to consider the possibility of my daughter marrying Major Mahasen.’
’Have you thought it over?’
’I have.’
’And?’
’Under the circumstances, Your Excellency, I don’t think –’
’Is that a no?’
Pause. ’I wish there was-’
’That’ll be all, General.’ Jara cut the line. 
　　　　***
Hasyl stopped the vehicle at the gates. <PLEASE PLACE RIGHT HAND ON SCREEN NOW>, an electronic voice spoke. Hasyl did so. <GOOD MORNING, MAJOR MAHASEN> ’Good morning, OVI’, Hasyl replied as the gate slid open. 
The Mahasen home and its surrounding front yard had changed little in its half century of existence. The driveway was a 200-yard semi-circle at the centre of which was the house. Everything was impeccably maintained. Ohiy stood at the entrance. ’You’ve gotten fat’, she said as Hasyl got down from the jeep. ’Nothing you say will stop me from hugging you, Miss Ohiy’, Hasyl retorted, walking up to her with his arms wide. ’It is good to see you, Miss Ohiy. It’s good to be back here. I’ve missed this, all of this.’ Ohiy patted his cheeks, ’It’s good to see you too, dear. Let’s go say hello to your grandmother.’ She left with him Ella as she went to supervise the rest of the housework. 
If Ella was excited to see Hasyl she barely twitched a muscle in showing it. She remained withdrawn, as if all her senses were turned inwards. ’So’, Hasyl began, ’I guess I better start by telling you what that surprise is right?’ He paused searching Ella’s face for any signs of interest. ’Okay. I am retiring from the army, grandma. I want to get into politics. I want to be by father’s side. It is time, don’t you think?’ Again, he paused more out of courtesy now. ’Right, exactly what I thought. I can’t go back there, can’t go back to the army, grandma. They are laughing, behind my back I know it, they are laughing. But it’s served me well, the army has. It opened my eyes. Out there among the natives, these others you realize they aren’t all out there fighting. Most just want three meals, their kids to be educated and the country to respect their way of life – like anyone would. And I won their respect. And I saw it is possible for us to live together, grandma. I saw it. I know it can be done.’ He paused again. ’I sound like an idealist fool, father will surely tell me, but idealists haven’t seen what I have. I can help. I know I can. I can end this before it turns to civil war.’
Ohiy was finalizing preparations when she noticed some movement behind Hasyl’s jeep. She lumbered closer and adjusted her glasses. ’Oh you frightened me, Miss Ohiy!’ Ohiy recognized the voice from behind the vehicle. ’Floa, is that you?’ ’Yes, Miss Ohiy. ’ ’What are you doing there?’ ’I dropped a coin. It rolled underneath the vehicle. Got it. ’ She stood and walked towards Ohiy. ’Where were you this morning?’ ’I apologize, Miss Ohiy. I got an urgent call from my folks at home.’ ’Is everything alright?’ ’It will be, I hope, by end of day.’ ’Fine, I understand but don’t abandon Miss Ella like that again. If you have to attend to a call, let me know so that I can be by Ella’s side during that time. Do you understand?’ ’Yes, Miss Ohiy.’ ’Good. Now help us with Miss Ella. We are going to the President’s house for breakfast.’ Floa nodded and strode out to attend to her duties. 
’A federation of self-governed states, grandma, under one central government. That will work, won’t it?’ Ella’s gaze bore past Hasyl and to the wall behind him. He sighed. ’I was hoping for a little excitement there, but I know some part of you understands what I am saying here. And I hope that part of you will give me your blessings.’ Ohiy walked in, ’Time for us to go. Your father hates it when we are late. Let’s go. Girl’, she beckoned Floa. The nurse pushed Ella’s chair along the hallway with Hasyl and Ohiy behind her. ’Did you have a good chat with your grandmother? ’ ’I did. I actually broke the surprise to her. ’ ’Will you tell me now?’ ’You are showing the impatience of a sixty-year-old,’ Ohiy pretended to whip his back with her walking stick, ’During breakfast, Miss Ohiy. I promise.’   	
Hasyl carried Ella down the stairs and into the jeep while Floa brought down the wheel chair. She loaded the wheelchair into the jeep and was about to get in her when her OVI device alerted her to an incoming call. 'Miss Ohiy', she stared. 'I am sorry, I think it is my family trying to reach me. May I please take this call?' 'We need to leave, girl. His Excellency is expecting us any moment.' 'That's alright, Miss Ohiy', Hasyl interrupted, 'You attend to your call, Floa. We'll send you a car as soon as we get there. Will you be ready in 15 minutes?' 'Yes, Major Mahasen. Thank you, I am grateful.' Hasyl waved her off and started the vehicle. 'She's a good one, that Floa', Ohiy commented as the Jeep began reversing. 'She's fantastic with grandma', Hasyl offered. Ohiy nodded in agreement. The vehicle was almost at the gates. 'Shit!' Hasyl broke the silence, '...sorry, Miss Ohiy. I left my OVI in grandma's room. Let me quickly run in and grab it.’ Hasyl turned off the vehicle and began sprinting up the driveway, into the hall, through the corridors that led to Ella's room. He noticed the OVI on the bed. He was sprinting back when he heard her voice from the adjacent room. She was crying.  He stopped running and strained to hear Floa. Failing he decided to knock on her door and see if she was alright. The door was ajar. The crying was more audible. 
'Please', she begged to the person on the other line, her back turned to Hasyl, 'Please don't make me do this. I've done everything you asked for! Please don't make me do this,’ she paused, 'Yes', seemingly answering questions, 'More than anything else. Please don't harm her. I've done everything you asked for! Sorry. Yes, I will be quiet. Yes, I want to see her again. No. No I am not having second thoughts. But those women, they've done nothing wrong. Yes. I remember. She died a horrible death. No. No I don’t think he has any regrets.'
'Are you alright?'
Hasyl's voice made her jump in fright, dropping her OVI device. The confused voice on the other end called out to her. Floa was still shaking while Hasyl tried to reassure her, 'I am sorry I frightened you, Floa. I heard you crying. Are you -'
'- what are you doing here? I saw you leave.'
'I realized I forgot my OVI. I came back and I heard you crying. Look do you want to tell your friend on the other line that you are okay. He sounds concerned.'
She leant on the wall, slid along its surface and sat on the floor with her hands on her head. 'I did everything they asked of me, but I can't do this', she buried her face. Hasyl picked up her OVI and clicked on the SPEAKER icon. 
'Hello. Thangam! Thangam!?', the voice on the other line called out. 
Hasyl cut the line. 'Who is the man on the other line? And why are you crying?'
'He has my child.'
'Is he your husband?'
'He's a monster.'
'Look I’ll help you get your child back. Stop crying.' She laughed. 'What's so funny?'
'What is funny, Major Mahasen is that you have no idea what's going on – and you want to help. Do you know if you had done your job I wouldn't be here?'
'What are you talking about?'
'Where were you that night, Major Mahasen? The night they raided my town, raped and killed my sister? Where you were when they burnt the library down? I want to know.'
'I am not going to discuss that', Hasyl stood and turned to leave. 
'My OVI. Give it to me.' Hasyl handed it back to her. 'Do you sleep at all?'
'Floa...Thangam, whatever your name is. You are crossing the line', Hasyl continued walking, aware that she was following him from behind. 
'I can't sleep, Major Mahasen. Ask me why! Ask me why!'
Hasyl stopped. He was out of the hall and could see the jeep near the gate when he turned around to address her. 'Stop. Right now. I know grief well – just as well as you do.'
'Do you? Then ask me why I can't sleep.'
Hasyl turned his back and began walking again, uninterested in the sparring. 
'I don't think you know grief, Major', she shouted, following him out of the hall and into the driveway. Hasyl turned back in annoyance, in time to see her press her OVI screen. 
Hasyl could barely remember the sound of the explosion, but he now recalled its sheer force. He felt as though a giant hand had casually flicked him away. Hasyl remembered his brief time of flight, crashing against a wall and falling on the grass. He remembered turning back and seeing the burning jeep. He remembered looking down his body and seeing countless shards of glass embedded into his left leg. He remembered the encroaching darkness that seemed to blot out the morning sun. 
　　　　***
'I believe in the sanctity of sexual congress. It is the only thing I believe in. I know that now. Before I knew this, I was lost, aimless. I was desperately looking for something to believe in. And trust me I tried. I wanted to believe in the inevitability of destiny as my grandfather used to say. I wanted to believe in my destiny to succeed my father. I wanted to believe that a Mahasen is meant for public service. But then a Circadian goddess came along and showed me that there was more to life than preordained path and that there was more to sexuality than fucking. Because we don’t fuck because it is a biological need. No. To shit and piss and vomit is biological. But to fuck? That, ma'am, is spiritual. And that's what I am interested in capturing with my camera. I believe a woman in orgasm is the universe re-enacting its own creation. Her eyes a black hole whose volatility in that moment of blissful communion with another soul births all that is, all that was, and all that ever will be. So, to the ones who dismiss my art as pornographic, including members of my own family back in Mirage, I say to them I don’t give a shit. You can go ahead and print that, all of it.'
'You mentioned your family, Manal. Can I ask what your relationship with your family, particularly your father, is like especially in light of your careers as a musician and now as a photographer?'
'My relationship with my father is - well, was - fine, what you'd expect between a single father and his eldest son: sometimes strained because he was overly demanding – or I was overly relaxed about the whole thing. But I wanted to make him happy and proud of me as any son would, but I am not a political machine like he is. I lied to him about my reasons for coming to Circadia. I told him it was for my studies. But in truth it was for a woman, the aforementioned Circadian goddess. He didn't find out till it was too late. By then the band was doing well and I didn't need his money. I have two younger brothers as you probably know. I am closer with my youngest than I am with Hasyl.'
'Major Mahasen.'
'Yes.'
'Your youngest brother, Dev Mahasen, was the first Miragian on the moon. That must have been a proud moment.'
'To echo my grandfather again, it was the inevitability of destiny. I still remember when he announced to the family that he'd live on the moon one day. We laughed.'
'How old was he?'
'Seven, if memory serves.'
'Bright child.'
'Bright, yes - he made up for what Hasyl and I lacked in our studies – but he had tenacity too. You need that to accept a shitty job like his.'
'I notice that you aren’t as quick to speak about Major Mahasen.'
'Hasyl and I have fundamentally different worldviews. He believes the military is necessary for discipline. I don’t give a shit about discipline. But he is still my brother, you understand?'
'Yes, I do.'
'So, I am not going to say more than that about Hasyl.'
'But can I ask you about your reaction to the news of the Naffaj town massacre by men in your brother's unit.'
'My brother is a soldier. He isn’t a lunatic. Now can we please -'
'- No one is painting him as such. If anything, all evidence points to your brother losing command of his own men.'
'Just because he was an ineffective military leader doesn’t make him a war criminal.'
‘Those are your words, not mine.’ [Your words, not mine. ]
'Look, he is still my brother. If we are going to discuss Hasyl, we will frame all questions around his relationship to me as my brother. His military career is of little consequence to me. Excuse me’, Manal apologized as a personal aide appeared at the door. He beckoned her to enter and she whispered the message to Manal's ears. 'I am sorry', he apologized to the reporter from The Circadian Times, 'I have an urgent call to take. Will you excuse me?' 
Manal stood and walked out to his private balcony. He pressed the ANSWER button on his OVI, bracing himself to hear a voice from the past. 'Manal here.' 'Mr Mahasen', the voice on the other end sounded unfamiliar. 'Who is this?'  'I am Avlis, I am your father's personal secretary.' 'What do you want?' 'I've been instructed by your father to pass the news before it is all over the media.' 'Get to the point, Avlis.' 'I am sorry, Mr Mahasen. There's been an assassination attempt on your brother.' Manal felt nothing. 'Major Mahasen is badly injured but miraculously survived the bomb blast, but I am afraid your grandmother and the maid died.' 'Maid?' 'Yes, I think she's called Ohiy. We expect Major Mahasen to survive. I've been instructed to tell you that the funerals for your grandmother and the maid -' 'Avlis, you call Miss Ohiy a maid again and I will see that you don’t have a job by the time I get there, do you understand?' 'Yes.' 'Expect me in Mirage tomorrow.' 'Yes, Mr Mahasen.' 'And, Avlis - how is my father?' Hesitation: 'He's recovered from the shock, but he'll need family around him. I'll have a vehicle to pick you up at the airport. My condolences, Mr Mahasen.'
　　　　***
The guitar riff and the cymbals descended upon the crowd like a giant wave crashing through a levee. Manal, already under the spell of the bassist, and near the loud speakers, felt its full force, and he reacted as he had never reacted before to any music: he jumped in primal, uncontrolled joy, keeping time to the band's serpentine rhythm. He followed the riff as the guitarist played variations of the original melody, he followed it as hypnotized as those children from the old tale who followed the piper. A curious thought entered Manal's head then as his body continued to shake uncontrollably: Do these musicians know that in moments such as this they hold more power in their hands, their throats and their feet than the most ambitious politician can ever come to experience? 
'What do you think?' Nnae shouted into his ear as the soundscape turned calmer. 
'They are so loud. So unbelievably loud. I have never heard anything like it', Manal shouted back into her ear as the mood of the song began to turn. Manal could feel the building of tension. They can't keep on piling like this anymore, surely? Yet, the band did, crafting a monolith made purely out of sound waves, where at its peak was the singer, the mad Sharman of this ritual, wailing the chorus into the mic. The crowd wailed along as the singer led them to the song's surprisingly gentle end. And just like that, the monolith began to disappear; all that remained was a few sparse notes as it faded way like a mist being dispersed by strong winds. The crowd screamed in approval, most throwing a hand sign that Manal didn’t recognize, but he grabbed the camera and captured the moment. He wanted to remember it. 
'What's that song called?'
'One Hundred Yearnings for Solitude', Nnae replied. 
She took Manal backstage later that night after the show. 'They are good friends. Come on, I'll introduce you', She knocked on a door that had an ANTHEMS FOR DOOMED YOUTH logo pasted on it. A thin man with an oval face and long hair appeared behind the door. It took him a few seconds to recognize her. 'Holy shit, Nnae! Guys', he turned to the people inside the room, throwing the door open, 'Nnae is here!'
The band got up and rushed to hug her. There were four of them. Nnae introduced each of them to Manal: Iric, the singer; Mik, the guitarist; Stoc, the oval-faced bassist; and Yannd, the drummer. The band invited them to join them for celebrations back at their base. 
Their base was a warehouse that served as living quarters, studio and practice hall, the guitarist told Manal in way of conversation. Inside, three girls introduced themselves to Manal and Nnae. Girlfriends, Manal guessed. The table was neatly lined with alcohol, a few pre-rolled joints, and food. 
'A toast', Iric called out, 'to our old friend Nnae. Welcome back. And to our new friend Manal. Welcome to our humble madhouse.'
Manal noted the twinkle in Nnae's eye as Iric looked in her direction.  
Wine drunk. Kanab smoked. Food consumed. 
When the music quietened, the silence was punctuated by the sound of loud sex from the cabins, metal beds banging against walls, screeching against floors. 'The echo is interesting', Manal said to which Iric laughed a like an actor who had rehearsed that laugh. Manal noticed that he was the only one of the band members without female company. As the night wore on, Manal found himself looking for Nnae in the thinning crowd, only to find her in the midst of deep conversation with Iric throughout. 
Old lovers? Even Manal's inebriated senses couldn’t dull animal jealousy.  Rolling a joint, Manal made his way to Iric and Nnae. 
'Can I butt in and offer a smoke?'
'You can do, Manal. We were just talking about you actually. It seems you've made this young lady a very happy young lady', Iric broke out that practiced grin. Manal couldn’t tell what was sincere and what was a veil.  
'I was just telling him about how we met', Nnae's tone didn’t betray the slightest guilt. Manal's mind eased. 
'Not every day we have the son of a President making merry with us', Iric said then. 'Yours is quite a story, Manal.'
'Mostly boring though, let me tell you.'
'Are you saying the story of how we met was boring?' Nnae asked, eyebrows raised. 
'No. I was saying that was the only exciting bit', he grinned and leaned in. They kissed. Her tongue briefly slithered into his mouth before parting ways. 'But honestly though, I don’t really like talking about it – '
'He doesn’t. Trust me I've tried', Nnae offered. 
' – if that's alright. I am sorry.'
'Oh hey, no need to apologize, Manal. Man. All. Are you? Or All Man? Sorry, I am drunk. I turn into a drunken parrot.'
'He does', Nnae offered again, this time looking to Manal. 
'So how do you two know each other? She's told me a lot about your band but didn’t mention she was such close friends with you guys.'
'She was probably afraid you wouldn’t approve of us mad fuckers.'
'Manal is a bit of a mad fucker too, isn’t he?' She leaned in and kissed him again, this time letting the tongue dance deeper. 'There is no other explanation for the perfect overlapping of our paths', she leaned closer then and whispered into his ear as smoke plumed out of her mouth, 'and the perfect intertwining of our bodies.' 
 'I'll give you two kids some space eh?' Iric said and walked away with that grin again. 
'Worship me', Nnae breathed into Manal's ear as they found themselves alone. 
Manal moved forward, pressing Nnae deeper into the cushioned oblivion of the couch. Tongue again, this time more leisured in its strolling. Her body shook as Manal's errant finger plunged under her skirt. 'What did I tell you?', she grabbed his wrist and pulled the finger out of her, 'I said', she clasped his neck, digging her nails into his skin, 'Worship me.' She pushed his torso downwards, his impatient hands already pulling the skirt down her legs.  Nnae pulled his hair, reigning Manal, directing him. 'Worship me, Manal. Worship me.'
Nnae’s body was a brewing storm. Wave upon wave, her shudders rippled underneath her thighs while her body creaked in anticipation of a tremendous release of energy – and when she did release, she exploded like a collage of bliss-hued vignettes. It was [At that moment ]at that moment Manal realised he had never fully appreciated the grandeur of the female orgasm. 
Nnae, unburdened from the primal feminine need to reciprocate her lover, was a woman in revelatory dance, unapologetically naked to the world, to herself, vulnerable one moment, powerful the next, giver and taker of that one miniscule point in time and space, this explosion of light that is so far away inside the vast emptiness of her eyes that men cannot simply comprehend it; in that moment, Manal understood, a woman was so powerful she was creation made flesh, blood, sound, sweat, skin, bone – and sin; for no man could experience such pleasures so intensely for so long.  
She pulled his face closer to hers. 'Do you trust me?', she asked out of breadth. 'Yes', Manal managed to splutter out as every atom of his body craved for every atom of hers, 'By Mother Mirage, yes!' he exclaimed aloud as he entered her. She pushed him aside and wrestled him into the cushion while mounting herself up. 
'Do you trust me?' she asked again as she straddled Manal. 
'Fuck me! Yes, Nnae. I trust you', he said thrusting upwards. Nnae's entire body inhaled as Manal watched a single drop of sweat on her neck, shuddering uncontrollably from the rumblings underneath. 'Don't question anything that happens in the next few hours’, she said while thrusting down hard when she wanted to emphasize a word. 
She got off him and stripped naked. 'Come with me', she led Manal through the warehouse. In every room, someone was on the verge of a lazy, drunken climax. Nnae continued leading him to a room on a loft up a staircase. She knew where the lights were. She pushed Manal on the bed and grabbed his wrists, bringing them together over his head. Nnae then calmly opened the bed side drawer, pulled out a pair of handcuffs and fastened his wrists to the bed post. 'Trust me', she said as her lips and tongue made their way down his torso, and again before her lips parted. All life, all gravity rushed downwards for Manal. 
‘You do that now’, Manal said grunting, ‘And I’ll have no choice but to fuck you until we both lose our minds.’
‘Do it’, she said, stopping briefly from her explorations. 
‘Nae, we are on someone else’s bed!’, Manal tried protesting. 
‘Do it.’
The voice was a man’s: Iric walked in naked and closed the door. 
The night was a blur of sweat, hair and ejaculate. When Manal woke up, he found himself passed out near the edge of the bed, his hands still handcuffed to the bed post, Nae asleep on Iric’s chest, and an odour that he knew wasn’t Nae’s. He longed to vomit but the urge to cry was stronger. 
‘Not quite “love-making”, no?’, Iric whispered. Manal turned over and realized Iric wasn’t asleep or hadn’t been for a while - and was watching Manal. But it was the comment that hit Manal; when Nae and he had started their secret meetings, he had innocently referred to their most carnal acts as ‘love-making’. ‘What we are doing isn’t quite love-making, Mr Mahasen’, Nae would tease before hurling her naked body at his. 
‘Where are the keys?’
Iric looked confused at first. ‘Right – the handcuff. It’s in the drawer by your side. 
‘I can’t reach it’, Manal mouthed the words slowly.
‘Well I can’t either – unless you want me to get up and wake Nae up in the process. Look at her: she’s sleeping like a drunk baby.’ Iric paused, watching Manal try desperately to reign in the emotional outburst that was longing to come, and grinned again. Manal had started to hate that grin. ‘I am joking, this thing doesn’t have a key. You can unlock it with your thumb like so’, he mimicked the action. Manal felt blood return to his wrists again. In the bathroom, Manal sank to his knees as he vomited and shat at the same time while forcing himself not to sob. Outside, he heard the bed banging rhythmically against the other side of the wall and a hungover Nae clumsily beg Iric, ‘Make me come before he gets back’. 
　　　　***
Try as he might, Manal would never be able to forget that smell. 
<As he got older, he’d adorn himself in increasingly strong perfumes and sanitary cleaners to kill the olfactorily illusion that he stank of a combination of faeces, vomit, urine, sweat and semen – so much so that he would objectively lose his sense of smell in a few decades while his mind continued convincing him that a rancid ghost clung on to him every moment of every day, whispering ‘Your stench will haunt the living and the dead.’>  
‘Buckle your seat belts please, Mr Mahasen. We are about to land.’ 
Even in his extremely sanitized private jet, 30,000 feet above the ground, heading straight to all that grief, the smell lingered. He buckled his seat belts. 
Avlis was waiting for him at the VIP lounge. Manal no longer expected to whisk through an airport unseen – this was the cost he had to pay for the ridiculous success in two separate careers. If Avlis disapproved of Manal’s highly progressive, cutting-edge Circadian fashion choices, he didn’t show it. He greeted and introduced himself with a sombre tone. ‘Mr Mahasen, I didn’t fully appreciate who Miss Ohiy was, and what she meant to your family. I am truly sorry I got off on a bad note by calling her that word.’ Manal was impressed, but didn’t show it. That word ‘maid’ had rung in his head since that phone conversation. He hated Avlis from that moment, but this career bureaucrat now surprised him. ‘It’s alright. Miss Ohiy was back stage for so long, people outside the family had no idea. Tell me: did the papers refer to her as that? A maid?’ 
‘In every public release of the attack and the subsequent funeral, we’ve referred to Miss Ohiy as a close cousin of your grandmother. I made sure of that, Mr Mahasen.’ 
Impressive. Manal nodded and walked ahead. ‘Should I expect media outside?’, he asked before opening the door.
‘We informed editors of all the dailies to stay away.’ 
The drive was initially silent. Avlis had the tact to let Manal stew in the rising grief that would inevitably erupt in the next few hours. ‘Where are we headed, Avlis?’ 
‘To the Presidential Palace’. 
‘What about our family home?’
‘The front of the house is badly damaged from the blast, Mr Mahasen. The PSD won’t allow anyone from the President’s family to go near the place until they’ve completely scoured it for…well’
‘More bombs?’
‘It’s a security risk, Mr Mahasen. They aren’t taking any more chances with the first family’s security. They’ll have much to answer for after your father is done with the funeral rites.’ 
‘Where’s Hasyl?’
‘Major Mahasen is in hospital. He’s stable, but the medical team want to keep him for observations for another day or so.’
‘How is he?’
Avlis inhaled. ‘He’s inconsolable. He won’t see anyone. Not even your father.’ 
‘Take me to him.’ 
‘But, Mr Mahasen –‘
‘Avlis, you have no choice on the matter.’
‘But your father’s –‘
‘My father’s orders aren’t to forcibly bring me to him – or has he become that much of an ego maniac?’
‘No, it’s just that –‘
This continued until the car drove in to the hospital. ‘I can’t guarantee that you’ll see Major Mahasen. He’s made it very clear he doesn’t want to see anyone, especially not family.’ 
Manal ignored him and walked into the lobby. Immediately eyes widened. Some gawked. The receptionist voice cracked as she struggled to remember what room and ward Major Mahasen was admitted in. ‘Look, Mr Mahasen. There’s protocol that needs to be followed in these matters.’ 
‘I was just beginning to like you, Avlis. Pity.’ 
They turned to a wide corridor that had VIP printed in beautifully inappropriate typography. Manal walked to the door that had PSD standing outside. They stepped in front of his path and shook their heads even before he got close. ‘I need to see my brother’, Manal was strangely calm. ‘What’s it going to take, eh lads?’, he fished out his wallet. Inside was mostly Circadian money. He threw the bills in their faces. ‘Here, take it. Circadian money. More than you’ll earn in a fucking year. Take it and move the fuck out of my way.’ They stood motionless and unimpressed.
‘What’s it going to take to get these monkeys to move, Avlis?’, Manal bellowed. 
‘Treat them with some respect for starters, Mr Mahasen’, Avlis stood behind. He motioned for Manal to move aside. He then spoke to them in hushed voice. A minute later, he turned to Manal, ’10 minutes if he agrees to see you – if. If he doesn’t, I’ll take you straight to presidential palace. No ifs and buts. Agree?’
The lights were turned down inside Hasyl’s room. Manal could hear light snoring in the shadows. As he was turning up the lights, Hasyl stirred. ‘Turn it down, how many times do I have to tell you people I have –‘, it was then Hasyl turned his head and saw Manal. Silence as the two brothers sized up one another for the first time in years. 
‘What the fuck are you wearing?’ 
‘Good to see you too.’
‘You look like an ostrich. And smell like a rich gypsy.’ 
‘I am not rich – I am wealthy. There’s a difference. You Miragians still can never seem to tell the difference.’ 
‘Well, fuck me. My leg’s blown to bits, I am going to be on a wheelchair for the rest of my life, and now I have to listen to economics lecures from my big brother.’ 
‘I was told you were inconsolable.’ 
‘This is me being inconsolable.’ 
‘Why haven’t you let father come see you?’ 
‘Why are you are worried about father’s feelings, suddenly?’
‘Do we have to do this now? I came here to grieve, Hasyl. Can I grieve? Can we? Maataach is gone. Ohiy –‘, Manal’s voice finally cracked. 
‘It’s my fault’, Hasyl said quietly. ‘This is all my fault.’ 
Anger and heart-break were fighting inside Manal. ‘You fucker. You’ve not changed, have you? Still need something or someone to blame. I’suppose the logical end of the road is when you start blaming yourself. Stupid fucker’, before he knew what he was doing, Manal found himself hugging Hasyl. For the first time since the day their mother died, the brothers cried in each other’s arms.  
Manal took a seat, wiping away his tears. 
‘Have you seen father since you returned?’
‘I just got in this afternoon. Came straight to you.’ 
‘Father needs someone around him.’
‘I’ll go see him after this. It won’t be easy.’
‘And Dev? Does he know?’, he paused. ‘Does he care?’ 
Dev and I are in touch. He takes time to respond. I passed the news. Haven’t heard from him yet.’ 
‘What’s he so busy with?’
‘I don’t know. Moon work?’ 
‘I really fucked him up too, didn’t I?’
‘Stop it.’
‘No, I mean I kept saying he killed mother. He was just a kid.’
‘You were an asshole. And now you are a self-aware asshole. Progress. Look, Dev’s not just shy or introverted or estranged from the family. I think he genuinely loathes most human interaction – why else would someone grab that shit job and be by themselves in that hellscape? Both you and father have to take blame for that. 
‘When all this is over, I’d like to talk to him. To say sorry.’
This was getting way too much for Manal. Cracks don’t repair themselves overnight. Even if Hasyl had seemingly turned the corner, it’d take years to get Dev to overcome the childhood trauma of an older brother constantly accusing him of killing their mother, and thereafter forgive Hasyl. 
‘All in good time’, Manal lied, already knowing Dev would scoff at the notion of reconciling with Hasyl and father. ‘We have to cremate our Mahasen women first.’ There was a knock on the door. ‘I am coming!’, Manal stood. ‘I promised them 10 minutes. I have to go see father now. I’ll come get you for the funeral, okay?’
Hasyl nodded. ‘I don’t know if I can do it.’ 
‘If you don’t, you are going to hate yourself for the rest of your life.’ 
‘I already do.’
‘I’ll get you help. Circadian doctors who treat this sort of thing.’ 
‘What, self-loathing?’ 
‘Survivors’ guilt. PTSD. Depression.’
‘How do you know these things?’ 
‘Therapy. Lots of it. It helped me. It’ll help you.’
‘You’d do that?’
‘You are still my brother, you fucker.’
‘I didn’t expect our reunion to be this, well I wasn’t expecting a reunion at all, but I didn’t expect one so.…what’s the word I am looking for?’
‘Surreal. The word you are looking for is surreal’, Manal said and walked out of the room. 
The drive from the hospital to the Presidential palace was less argumentative as Avlis gave Manal space. As they turned into the palace, Manal made a mental note to not let his emotions get the better of him this time around. There’d be no tearful reunion, of that he was sure. 
Jara, watching from the window of his office, felt something flutter when he saw the strange, lanky man with the long, braided hair and heavy beard, step out of the car. Mother Mirage! It was one thing to see the monstrosity in photos and in video, but another to see it in real life. This is where all that money went? For him to walk around looking like a Circadian clown? 
Manal was ushered in, taken through the hall way, through a few wide corridors and into the residential wing. Manal had been at the palace a few times after his father’s first electoral victory; nothing impressed him fifteen years ago, nothing about it impressed him now. The palace was a poor nation’s attempt at pomp and grandiosity, to show off to the world. Portraits of past presidents, The Trinity, and important foreign dignitaries in choreographed poses with Jara. Miragian lined the hallway, leading to Jara’s private office. Interesting, no pictures of paataach. He made a mental note of the final observation. 
The PSD at the door raised their eyebrows as this eccentrically dressed man walked up to them, flanked by a man, comically juxtaposed, in standard bureaucrat-wear. Manal ignored them as the Avlis knocked on the door. 
Jara had just sat at his desk when he heard the tap. ‘Come.’ 
Avlis stepped in first, closed the door, came out a minute later and nodded to Manal. ‘He’ll see you now.’ 
Jara pretended to read a document as Manal was let in. He didn’t lift his eyes off the document even as his eldest son walked back into Jara’s life for the first time in 15 years. Manal, for his part, didn’t wait to be invited to sit. 
‘Most people have the courtesy to wait until I invite them to sit’, Jara said, his eyes still on the paper. 
‘Most people grieve when loved ones are taken away cruelly.’
Jara snorted, ‘Leaves home with my money, doesn’t come back, doesn’t keep in touch with his family, but is now lecturing me about grief.’ 
‘Put that paper down father. If you are going to be snide, at least have the decency to do it to my face.’ 
‘If I put this down, snide remarks will be the least of your worries’, Jara tried to mimic the ice-cold tone with which he had disciplined Manal since childhood. 
It was Manal’s turn to snort, ‘Threatening a grown man, are we?’ 
‘No, attempting to discipline him. Much like a kennel master with a mad dog.’
‘Is this why you wanted me here? Did you get everything off your chest? Does this feel good?’
‘I’ll feel better when you pay me back for the money you stole.’ 
‘I didn’t steal anything. You gave me it me for my studies.’ 
‘And this’, Jara snapped, throwing the paper on the floor and pointing at Manal, ‘is the result? You look like you work in a circus! I gave the money to you because you lied. You made it sound like you had finally grown up.’
Manal’s face had turned to stone. ‘Fuck this family’, he muttered while shaking his head. ‘We aren’t going to grieve like normal people, but we are going to bicker over money? At a time like this? You want your money?’
‘Fuck this family? Well this family considered you dead when you lied to me and stole my money.’ 
Manal had had enough. He stood and took his OVI out, ‘You want the money? Well you can have it. OVI’, he addressed the device. ‘I want to transfer funds into a Miragian bank account.’
‘Certainly’, the device said. ‘Please stand still as I verify biometrics.’
‘Right, how much do I owe you? You gave me 50,000 Circadian Rūpyas? No, I am feeling generous. OVI what is the amount owed for 100,000 Circadian Rūpyas at, I don’t know, 30% interest for 15 years?’ 
‘12%’, Jara interjected. ‘Does Circadian education not cover basic economics?’ 
‘Oh no no, father, you started this, I am going to end this on my terms.’
‘5,118,589 Rūpyas’, OVI announced. 
‘Wonderful. Transfer that amount to my father’s bank account at the Miragian National Savings Bank.’ 
‘What are you doing?’, Jara’s eyes widened. 
‘Ending this how I should have ended this years ago’, Manal said, a manic smile on his face. 
‘Transfer complete’, the device said a few seconds later. 
‘Isn’t technology amazing, father? A snap of my thumb, and you’ve made more money than 15 years as Miragian president. Have fun explaining that to the state auditors’, Manal turned and walked to the door. ‘I’ll see you at the funeral – you do remember that there’s a funeral tomorrow, right? You fucking prick.’ 
Manal slammed the door on his way out where Avlis was waiting for him. ‘Are you loyal to my father, Avlis?’ 
‘What?’ 
‘Are you loyal to my father?’ 
‘Yes, of course I am.’ 
‘Does he value it?’ 
‘Sorry?’
‘Does he value your loyalty?’ 
Jara, hearing the commotion outside his private office, stepped out. 
Manal pointed at him, ‘What does this bean-counting prick pay you for your loyalty?’ 
Avlis had expected the day to be awkward but now it had gone off the rails. ‘I am not liberty to divulge – ‘
‘Well whatever it is, I’ll double it. Leave him and come work for me in Circadia as my private secretary. You’ll have a nice Circadian home, vehicle, chauffeur, bring your family, bring a girlfriend if you like’, he then turned to Jara. ‘Maataach is gone. So is Ohiy. By the time I am done in this trip, everyone you trust will leave you – and that includes Hasyl. Yeah, that’s right: I spoke to him. He saw me. Your favourite child’s leg is blown to smithereens, and the only one from the family he’d see is me. Not you. I hope you die alone and miserable, Jara Mahasen.’ 
As Manal stormed out, Avlis running behind him in a bid to calm the situation down, Jara knew he’d never see his son again. Was it heartbreak that he was feeling? Was he numb? He knew tragedy well, but this was new. This was murky, a clotting up of his psyche the likes of which even his father’s death hadn’t prepared him for. He wanted to weep. He wanted to shout. He wanted vengeance on those who dared to hurt his family. But mostly, Jara Mahasen just wanted to sleep, but now the nightmares would have new material to work with – he wouldn’t give it the opportunity to wreck him. Sleep will have to wait. 
Having sped off, Manal was by himself in the vehicle. He instructed the vehicle to take him to the funeral parlour where the bodies were being finalized for public display. It’d be a closed casket affair. All Manal wanted to do was to grieve, but so far, he had tended to his broken brother and burnt the last remaining bits of a bridge to his father. 
The undertakers weren’t expecting anyone from the family, but reacted like undertakers do when he turned up at the reception; they knew who he was and, after a brief discussion, allowed him for private time with the bodies. 
‘Mr Mahasen, the temptation will be there to open the casket and say goodbye. It’s only natural to do so, but for your sake – and the dignity of these two women – we strongly urge you to refrain’, saying that, they left the room.
Manal dragged the chair to be closer to the caskets. He had forgotten to ask which casket had his grandmother, and which one housed Ohiy. He contemplated calling the undertaker in and verifying but he didn’t want to talk to anyone. 
‘I don’t know what we are going to do without you in our lives. The evidence of the last few hours isn’t great. Father and I are done for good. Hasyl is broken, body and spirit – I’ll do my best to fix him but you were his anchor too. That’s the thing; no matter how much we fought among ourselves, all of us Mahasen boys loved you. Our rock. I don’t know how you did it. I couldn’t. We throw ourselves into the fire, this family, emerge surprised that we are burnt and broken, and expect those around us to pretend like all this is normal. I couldn’t do it. I still don’t know if I can. And I am one of them! No matter how much I fight against it, I am still a Mahasen. I promise you I am going to do better with Hasyl. I’ll bring Dev back into the fold too. It’s the least I can do’. Manal paused. There was so much he wanted to tell her. ‘I am sorry for not being in touch. I just didn’t want to put you in a position where father would be annoyed with you for being in touch with me. Did you know he thinks I stole–‘, he paused again, suppressing a sob that seemed to bubble from deep inside but it was too late. ‘I don’t know what we are going to do without you. 30 years ago, when mother died, I was so scared that we’d drift away and become strangers inside that fucking house. We didn’t. And that was because of you. But it was always inevitable. And now it’s here. I’ll fight the inevitable because that’s what you’d want me to do. Thank you for everything you did for me. For us. We could never begin to repay you, but now we’ve also failed to protect you. I wanted so much to take you to Circadia and live with me there. I wanted your last years to be peaceful and serene with rest being your only responsibility. You would have hated it, that lazy, unhurried, all convenience Circadian life, but I’d have made you come around. Forgive me for my faults over the years. I am trying. I am trying to be a better man, every day. You were the best of us. I’m performing your final rites tomorrow – I hope you’d approve. I love you, Miss Ohiy. Rest in Peace.’ 
He stood and contemplated opening the caskets, but he knew it’d shatter him senseless. 
He spent a restless few hours in bed but when sleep didn’t come, he decided on a late-night drink. The streets of the capital city had changed drastically in the last decade. Painted signages had transformed into garish neon lights that were all the rage in Circadia a few decades back. Only night owls and the army were on the streets – all too tired or too drunk to realize one of the most famous men in the world, the eldest son of the president, was walking among them. In some of the dimly lit neighbourhoods, prostitutes smoked and struck tired poses. ‘Show you good times, handsome?’, one asked as he walked past her. 
‘No’, Manal said, ‘but join me for a drink? I’ll pay.’ 
‘You buy drink then nothing more than-‘, she mimicked a handjob. 
‘- No, no. I don’t want that. Or anything. Just your company’, Manal clarified. 
‘I am whore, sweetie. Not girlfrie-‘
Manal placed a wad of notes in her hand, ‘Here. Now will you join me?’ 
‘You strange, sweetie’, she said, taking the notes and putting into her bag. ‘Buy me a drink then.’
Since nothing was opened, they walked back to the hotel he was staying in. He ordered room service and invited her into his suite. 
She whistled as she saw the size of the suite and sheer opulence of its interiors. ‘Fancy sweetie, you!’ 
Manal shrugged. He was pouring the drink. 
‘What’s on your mind, stranger?’, she asked after they toasted. ‘Someone die?’ 
Manal ignored the question and sat. They drank in silence. 
‘I can’t sleep nights’, Manal began, ‘if I don’t fuck.’
Her head titled like a confused dog. ‘You fuck every night?’
‘Yes. Every night.’
‘Same’, she said and laughed at her own joke. ‘Do you want to fuck now?’
Manal hesitated. ‘Yes, but I am trying not to.’ 
‘Then what’s all this?’
‘I don’t know.’ 
‘You pay already. Wait’, she paused: ‘D’you want to fuck – or get fucked?’ 
The next morning, Manal woke to Avlis at the door. He let him in and walked around naked to shower and then dress. Avlis didn’t flinch, but his expression changed slightly when he saw the scattered clothes and a woman on the bed. He said nothing until Manal came out dressed, his hair tied to a bun, and in the customary white required for Miragian funerals, ‘I wish your father could see you now.’ 
‘Why?’ 
He hesitated, ‘He told me to decline your request to perform Miss Ohiy’s funeral rites on account of…your fashion choices.’ 
‘It wasn’t a request, Avlis. You know this very well.’ 
‘I do, but I was briefing him on the funeral arrangements – and this came up.’ 
‘Who’s going to perform the rites for Miss Ohiy then?’
‘Major Mahasen.’ 
‘Major Mahasen. Fuck’s sake. Does my father even know his favourite has to spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair?’ 
‘I asked him the same thing.’ 
‘And?’
‘Hasyl just has to place the flame on the pyre. Everything else, he’ll do – for both women.’ 
Manal shook his head in disbelief at his father’s pettiness, ‘I’ll talk to Hasyl – don’t worry, Avlis, you won’t get in trouble on our account.’ 
Hasyl had been discharged from the hospital and gone to his residences where he had a full-time nurse and around the clock security. Army security needed time to be convinced that this strange looking man was indeed Major Mahasen’s brother. Avlis waited by the vehicle. 
This was the first time Manal had been in Hasyl’s home. The insides was sparse except for framed photographs and newspaper cut-outs. Manal was struck by one he hadn’t seen before: it showed his father, holding Hasyl and Manal on either side, silhouetted against a funeral pyre. Full circle Manal thought to himself as Hasyl was wheeled into the living room. 
‘Why aren’t you dressed yet?’
Hasyl made no eye contact. He had a newspaper in his hand which he threw in Manal’s direction. 
It was The Miragian. On it, under the front-page news, was an innocuous looking headline. It had Manal’s name. ‘MANAL MAHASEN: (MY) BROTHER IS “INEFFECTIVE MILTARY LEADER – NOT A WAR CRIMINAL.’ His hands shook in rage.
‘What the fuck do you know about warfare?’, Hasyl asked, his gaze still averted. 
‘Hasyl, this is a misunderstanding. They’ve picked a quote out of-‘ 
‘Answer my question: what the fuck do you know about war? About the military? What the fuck do you know about putting life on the line, Manal?’ 
‘Hasyl, listen to me. We can discuss this straight after the funeral, I promise.’
‘Answer my question’, Hasyl’s voice was strangely calm, his gaze still elsewhere. 
‘I know nothing.’
‘Then who’, he finally turned towards Manal, ‘the fuck are you to be passing judgement on my military career?’ 
‘I am sorry, Hasyl. I can explain this.’ 
Hasyl was shaking his head even before Manal was done with the sentence. ‘No. No. You’ve explained enough. Take your faggot presence back to Circadia. I don’t ever want to see or hear from you again’, he turned to the nurse who seemed to have frozen in awkwardness at what she was witnessing. ‘Show him out’, he told her. 
‘Hasyl, come on now! There’s a funeral, and you are performing the final rites for Miss Ohiy.’ 
‘Guards!’, Hasyl shouted as he was being wheeled away. ‘Show my guest out. I don’t want him let in again.’ 
Avlis knew something was off when he saw Manal got in and slammed the door shut. ‘I am going to ask you a question and for once I don’t want your response to be another question. Clear?’
Avlis nodded his head. 
‘Did you have anything to do with that headline on The Miragian?’
‘I didn’t even read the papers today so I have no idea what you are on about, but I don’t oversee the press. Your father has a Propaganda Department for that.’ 
‘Let’s go’, Manal ordered. 
The smell of incense and rosewater was strong at the cemetery. The caskets were laid out in a pyre built to accommodate two. The portraits of the two women in front. His father, flanked by the PSD, some minsters, civil servants, and party loyalists were there. Manal noticed his mother’s family hadn’t turned up. So, this is it? This is family? A bunch of politicians and bureaucrats? 
A Samanian priest walked around with a bell, ringing it every time he finished circling the pyre. <Miragian funerals have three variants, depending on which First Ancestor’s tribe a Miragian’s lineage traced back to. The Samanian tradition, to which the Mahasens belonged to, was minimalist – in that it required only one priest – but it lasted the longest. A Samnian priest had to go around the pyre clockwise equal to the number of remaining blood relatives. If there was 40, he’d have to do 40 rounds. The Mahasen Matriarch required only four – for Jara, Manal, Hasyl and Dev. Since Ohiy didn’t have blood relatives, she wouldn’t get any. That problem was solved by the double pyre.> 
When he had finished, the priest chanted the funeral prayer, calling out the names of the surviving relatives, punctuating each name call by lighting a fresh wick and laying it inside an oil lamp. The fires of the wicks combined to form the flame that would then light the torch used to finally light the pyre. The priest called Jara’s name and handed him the torch to be lit. Jara lit the torch and turned to face the pyre. 
Bare-chested and covered in rosewater, Jara shivered as the wind picked up. A storm was forming. ‘Hurry’, the priest pushed him towards the pyre. Jara lit it, twice – making sure to push the flame into the separate compartments of the two caskets. When he was done, he turned and scanned the faces of everyone in attendance. He didn’t know half their names. His eyes met Manal’s just as the crowd began to disperse. Father and son, flanked by PSD and Avlis, stood watching the pyre slowly crumble and crackle. 
‘Why did you do it?’, Manal asked. 
‘Hasyl is all I have. You can’t take him away from me’, Jara said. Both their attention was on the pyre. 
‘You are willing to humiliate one son to get back at another. You are willing to break a very fragile relationship between your sons, just so you can have your way’, Manal shook his head in disbelief. ‘I can’t do this with you anymore. Don’t look in the mirror, Jara. You won’t like what you’ve become.’ 
Manal walked to the vehicle where Avlis was already waiting for him. 
‘Why are you still here, Avlis?’ 
‘Your father asked me to be by your side from the moment you land until the moment you leave.’
‘A nanny then?’, Manal asked as he got in. Avlis got in front. 
‘Where to, Mr Mahasen?’ 
‘I want to see the house one more time. I want to spend some time inside it.’ 
The vehicle made its way to the old Mahasen home. The PSD had given their clearance and now as they drove in, for the first time since the blast, Manal saw what destruction the bomb had wrought on his childhood home. The façade was covered by a tarp to cover its blackened face. Window frames were mangled. Workers were busy clearing the rubble, and sanitizing the driveway and the walls where burnt flesh had left visible stains. 
‘Stay here, Avlis.’
<It’d be the last time Manal would step inside his family home. The next day, he flew back to Circadia, vowing to never return.>

<Nomad: The Eternal Journey of the Dom People, BY ANAKA-ODONATA ZIROMT, Pg 35>  
Those who run away from their lives, as I did when I chose to join the Štar clan’s pilgrimage, have little time to choose what they take with them. I had even less choice, hundreds of miles as I was from my home. I had packed clothes for a week and my OVI tablet when leaving for the desert town. These, along with Fifty Rūpya in cash, were all I had that reminded me of my previous life. 
The tablet, much to my surprise, became the most useful. Let me explain. I have always entertained a natural distance between myself and technology. I am not in any way suggesting that I was resistant to it, but that I was afraid I’d be transfixed by the screen that was no longer a window to our real world but a newer, virtual world we were building sans the ugliness, sanitized, homogenous, and with a logo attached to it all. Still, pragmatism won over: OVI tablets proved to be useful in my studies and indeed I took it to Sikar in the first place to help with voice-recording of interviews and other tasks I might be assigned during our week-long interaction with the Dom.  As I packed on the morning I was to leave Sikar with the Štar clan, I wondered what was sillier: a diplomat’s daughter considering running away with a nomadic tribe or she running away with nomads, with her most useless possession in hand. 
I didn’t expect much use of it. There’d be no wireless signals for it to pick up (though I had no plans to be on OVI as I traversed the desert). During the first three months I had barely taken it out of the bag, preferring to spend as much time with my new friends, especially Di and children her age. 
I must admit that I grew to be quite fond of Di very quickly – a relationship that has only strengthened as she has grown into a wonderful young woman. One evening, as Di slept on my lap, Štar, stroking Di’s hair, said, ‘You fond of this little one, girl.’ 
‘Yes, I am. She is the first friend I made here’, I paused, adding with a wink, ‘After you that is.’ 
She didn’t smile back and I wondered why: Štar was very generous with her mirth. She was clearly troubled.
‘Are you alright, Štar?’ 
She nodded, slowly. ‘Thinking’ 
‘What about?’ 
‘Miragians believe in coincidence?’   
‘I can’t speak for all Mirage. Me? No.’ 
She continued nodding her head as if she was listening to a song only she could hear. 
‘Why?’, I asked. 
‘The two of you no coincidence’ 
This puzzled me. ‘I don’t understand, Štar’ 
‘I do?’ With that, she rose. ‘Sleep, girl. See Lord Hexa tomorrow. He will know.’ 
Udupi was our last stop before we set off on the final leg of the journey, a hundred miles south to the shores of Lake Circadia. A truly remote village nestled in the heart of the mountains and home to one hundred families or so, it is, at first sight, little different to the countless hamlets that we’d already passed through. But as you venture towards this village through the Ghats, you come to inevitably know his name. If memory serves me right, I first came to know of him because of a spray-painted wall. We were passing through the town of Valsad, about 300 miles north, and on the front wall of a school was his likeness, spray-painted by an overzealous youth. 
The painting itself was shoddy, but it was the conceptual underpinning that I was drawn to; the long-haired warrior had not one but six heads and six pairs of hands, each bearing a weapon. I remembered even then struggling to reconcile his apparently cherubic face with the overt implications of violence. I dismissed it from my mind, but found variations of the same symbolism recurring throughout our journey. Sometimes it’d be another spray-painted wall, sometimes a hastily stuck poster on a mile-post, more than once I saw it on t-shirts. My curiosity piqued I asked Štar who this six-headed man was. 
‘He warrior prince, but he choose to live quiet life in mountains. We will see him in Udupi.’ 
‘Why six heads and six pairs of hands?’ 
‘You will see’, was her cryptic response. 
I was, then, admittedly excited at the prospect of meeting this individual who seemed to inspire naked idolatry among rural populations along the Ghats. I rose early the next morning and made my way down the river with Di. As she was bathing, I sat on a rock and took my OVI out for the first time since I left Sikar. I hadn’t read anything since then and wanted to pick something up from my virtual library and read a few pages that day.
‘What that, Dragonfly?’ Di, wading in a calm pool of water by the rocks, shouted over the rumble of the rushing water behind her. How do you explain an electronic tablet to a child who knew only a nomadic life?
‘I’m reading a book’, I replied, no conviction in my voice. 
Di laughed. ‘I see books before. This no book.’
I explained to her how this ‘book’ allowed me to read any book I wanted, simply by pressing a button. 
‘Books heavy’, Di retorted. 
This went on for a while until Di, unconvinced by my answers, went on a new line of inquiry: ‘What does book say?’
I told her. The questioning continued – my OVI opened at the last book I was reading in Sikar, the late Yara Mahasen’s unpublished A History of Time and Time Again, and Di’s curiosity found me desperately trying to recall details of the story – until it reached its logical climax: ‘I wish I read story, it wonderful’, Di said.
This simple statement hit me like a tremendous wave. During those first months travelling with the Štar clan, I often asked myself how I could be more useful to these people who, for no reason other than the goodness of their hearts, had allowed me to accompany them. They had fed me, given me shelter and taught me much of their way of life. What was I going to do in return? Every full moon, as the pilgrimage closed in on Lake Circadia, I would mull this question in my head. Out here, I was useless. There was nothing of note I could share, I thought. But now I knew. 
I beckoned Di to come out of the water and sit next to me. ‘Would you like me to teach you to read?’ She nodded, her enthusiasm quite obvious. Why had I not realized this before? I rebuked myself.  We had our first lesson by the river that day. 
Sometime later we made our way back to the camp. Štar, Di and I by her side, led the rest of the clan to the village. I have already alluded in earlier sections about the sheer crudeness (sometimes cruelty) with which the Dom are sometimes received by so-called civilized societies. Udupi, I was happy to note, was one of the few exceptions. If anything, the residents of the village hardly paid us any heed, their attention grabbed by the events around a hut at the end of the path. The excitement in the crowd was palpable. 
I carried Di and let her sit on my shoulders so she could get a better view.
‘See nothi –‘, Di said when I asked her what she could see. ‘Wait –‘
‘What?’
‘Big bird with feathers and snake outside door.’
This didn’t make any sense. The crowd hushed. 
‘Bird moving, Dragonfly!’
‘What bird?’ 
‘Is blue feathers like rainbow behind.’
A peacock? I wondered. ‘Bird coming close – now snake!’
I looked around, trying to sense if the crowd was on the verge of panic. No. 
‘Some come out hut, Dragonfly.’
She was excited and almost jumping having forgotten that she was sitting on my shoulders. ‘Two women, Dragonfly!’ The crowd was still hushed. Most had their palms clasped together and open, as in prayer. I sought Štar out from the crowd. 
‘Dragonfly, look man from picture!’
A chant seemed to explode from within the crowd. 
Arohara! The crowd affirmed out aloud. Arohara! They repeated, their hands closed and above their heads. I managed to locate Štar in the midst of the throng. 
The ceremony seemed to go on for a while and I am sparing you, dear reader, of any further description because I saw none of it – only hearing commentary from my young companion. When it ended, the crowd gathered in a long, orderly queue. Štar had us also join one of the long lines. As we moved up the queue, I could better make out the two women, the man, and indeed the bird (yes, it was a peacock) and the snake which had by now coiled around the man’s neck and – forgive my unqualified observation – seemed to be asleep. The man was evidently at ease because he paid the serpent little attention. The queue, I saw now, led a large table arranged with food: the man and the two women were presenting parcels of food to the entire village. 
I turned around to Štar: ‘Does this happen every day?’ 
‘No’
‘Why today then?’
‘Hexa married. This wedding.’
‘Who did he get married to?’ 
‘Both’, she referred to the women flanking him. 
It was now my turn. I walked towards Hexa. The spray-painted walls, posters and t-shirts exaggerated many things – he did not, for instance, have six heads or six pairs of hands; but his youthful face wasn’t an embellishment. I hazarded a guess at his age: twenty-five? Thirty? But there was a gravitas of an old man that was immediately apparent. 
‘You are not from our village, are you, sister?’ the fluency with which he spoke Circadanese jolted me from my reverie; I hadn’t heard that language since the day I joined the walk. His voice also belied his face: gravelled and throaty, the voice of a compulsive smoker. 
‘Girl with us, Lord Kartikeya’, Štar interjected. 
‘Step forward, sister’, he handed me the food, packed neatly in giant banana leaves. ‘You are most welcome here.’ 
‘Thank you, Lord Kartikeya’, I spluttered. 
Di and I moved along after receiving our parcels of food. We looked around and saw those who stood in front of us had unpacked their parcels under shady trees and begun eating. We joined them. The food – rice, lentil stew and an assortment of vegetable curries – wasn’t merely delicious, but a feast for all the senses. As we ate, I noticed the wives making their way to us. ‘Friends!’ one of them exclaimed in Dom as they got closer. Štar and the rest of the clan stood. ‘Friends, honour us by coming to wedding. Thank you.’ Štar bowed and I followed. She turned towards me. Štar pointed, ‘Is Dragonfly. And this’, she looked towards the child, ‘one Di.’ 
‘Dragonfly and Di – lovely pair you make’, one of the women said smiling. She had longer hair and a wider hip, and, bending down, carried Di. ‘You pretty one’. Her companion was noticeably younger, perhaps no older than me. ‘I Valli’, the younger one said. ‘And this my sister Teyvanai. Our husband like to see three of you.’ Confused, I turned to Štar. She took my hand and we made our way to the hut. At its entrance stood, as Di had accurately described earlier, the peacock and the snake. The snake was alert and almost seemed to be guarding the entrance of the hut. The peacock was brooding a little further away in the front yard. Seeing Teyvanai and Valli, the snake slithered aside and the bird, eyes boring into us strangers, stepped aside. 
The hut was sparse: a large bed at the far side the only noticeable furniture. There were no chairs, no boxes, nothing. The ladies continued walking straight through the main room of the hut towards a door that led to a backyard that itself seemed to lead into a rainforest. We came out of the hut and walked for a while along the path through the rainforest until we came to a clearing. A hundred or so meters ahead, meditating a few feet away from a precipice, was Hexa. 
‘Go’, Teyvanai said to Štar who, still clasping my hand, led me towards him. ‘What about Di?’ I asked puzzled. ‘We play with the little one. You go now’, Teyvanai said, her voice giving me little cause to worry. When Štar and I reached close enough to the precipice, my clumsy footsteps breaking countless twigs in the process, we found Hexa with his eyes opened and alert. The smile from earlier had disappeared. Now there was concern. 
‘Good seeing you, old friend’, he said. 
‘Honour ours, Lord Kartikeya. Us Dom not invited to weddings.’ 
‘Not often I get married’, he quipped. ‘Is she the one?’
‘No’, said Štar. ‘Little one playing with your wives. This one is a Miragian.’  
‘Sit’, he motioned to both of us. ‘You trying?’ his question pointed to Štar. 
‘Everyday, Lord Kartikeya. There is nothing inside. I am lost in darkness when I try.’ 
He was pensive. ‘I want to help, Štar but my powers…I have little.’
This was too much. ‘Wait’, I interjected, breaking their conversation. I could see annoyance flash across Štar’s face. ‘I need to know – ‘
‘Girl’, Štar snarled. ‘This not Mirage. This not Circadia. This our way. Sit. Shut up. Listen’, her attention turned back to Kartikeya. ‘Forgive her, Lord –‘
Kartikeya waved her off. ‘What is your name, girl?’, he switched to perfect Miragian. 
‘Dragonfly’
‘Your Miragian name’, he specified. 
‘Anaka’, I said after a brief hesitation. 
‘The All-Seeing one’, he broke out into a teasing smile. The tension disappeared. ‘Do you want to know why you are here, Anaka?’
I nodded. Kartikeya looked at Štar who sighed: ‘Štar has never read Di’s eyes.’ 
Allow me to just add some context here before I describe the rest of the conversation. You are by now aware that I ran away with the Štars after a conversation with their matriarch during which she exclaimed she had read my eyes and seen a dragonfly that needed to fly away. It is rational for some of you to assume you that I had lost my senses in allowing a ranting old woman to possibly trick me. But it wasn’t so. You see my middle name, Odonata, is from Circadian mythology. I don’t wish to go into the details of the story, but it involves a warrior princess named Odonata being turned into a dragonfly by her great-great-great grandfather, the Lord of all creation. No one I was with at the time in Sikar even knew my middle name. None of my companions knew of my burgeoning desire to leave my life and see the world. But Štar somehow knew. It would be rational of me to dismiss her utterance then as coincidence, an unusual serendipity of vagueness overlapping with the circumstances of my life, a happy occasion that most soothsayers long for, but I don’t believe in coincidences. It is not because I think Štar is clairvoyant, but I do believe that she is gifted in some way that allows her to gauge the totality of every person who comes into contact with her. During my first weeks, in an effort to understand the social structures that held a Dom clan together, I observed Štar closely to understand the extent of influence and power she wielded as the clan’s matriarch. It is tremendous and I’d like to think that this power comes from her special ability to simply read a person, whether stranger or otherwise, in an instance. I would humbly venture forth this further summary of my observations during this period. The matriarchal foundations of both Dom and Miragian societies is an area of study that would give us interesting insights into some questions that are increasingly salient: Why, for instance, in an age where matriarchal foundations are generally eroding (or allowed to erode away) across the world, do some cultures fight this erosion, and others do not? Why is there an undercurrent of apparent resentment in Mirage that our society still owes theological fidelity to an embodiment of female energy? Why are some so-called liberal clergy of the three faiths so adamant in giving theological precedence to The Trinity over this primordial female energy? Why are our clergy all male, while among the Dom it is a matriarch who is the centre of their universe? 
The revelation that Štar couldn’t read Di’s eyes, therefore, was a surprise to hear. I looked at Štar. 
‘Dark there, girl’, she said. 
‘Dragonfly know how Štar found little one?’ Kartikeya asked Štar. She shook her head. 
I had heard rumours that Di was an orphan, I assumed from another Dom clan, who lost her way and found Štar. And me. 
‘Last Walk’, Štar said meaning the pilgrimage from last year. ‘In desert, far away, on dune, naked, alone…we named her Di.’  
‘She was wandering the desert all by herself?’ I asked, incredulous. 
‘Fell from the sky into sand.’ 
‘Or someone abandoned her’, I reasoned. I found myself angry at the sheer thought. 
‘Not Dom’, Štar countered. ‘She daughter of Thar, she of sand, not flesh – why I can’t read her. 
‘Or’, Kartikeya stepped in, ‘Di only see future – no memory, no past in eyes to read.’
‘No stories in future, Lord Kartikeya’, Štar protested. 
‘Not for us, old friend. Little one a different breed, next step in cycle.’
Štar was silent now. ‘I don’t understand why we are so worried’, I said, breaking the silence. ‘Di’s just a little girl.’ 
‘Understand nothing, you’, Štar replied, ‘Di no memory inside – not me, not people who shelter’, she paused. ‘Not you.’ 
‘She’s just a little girl!’ I raised my voice. I was exasperated thinking that this harmless little girl should provoke such worry. ‘She’s just a little girl’, I repeated. 
 She rose and trudged back towards his wives and Di. Kartikeya cleared his throat: ‘Why are you here?’, he switched to Miragian again. 
‘That’s no business of yours, Lord Kartikeya’, I tried hiding the arrogance in my voice but failed. He pretended to not notice my conceit. ‘Do you even know why you are here?’ I stared back, choosing to not reply. ‘Answer me, girl. Do you even know why you are here?’ 
‘Yes’
‘Why?’
‘I wanted to see the world’
‘And you choose to do that by running away from your Miragian castle?’ 
‘I don’t live in a cas –‘, I stopped myself. ‘Lord Kartikeya, I mean no disrespect but please understand I only want what is best for Di.’ 
‘There’s your answer’
‘Answer? What are you -?’
‘I asked you if you knew why you are here. You do. You are here for her. I think’, he wagged his finger, ‘your fate is Di’s and Di’s fate is yours. And I think you’ve known this longer than anyone else has.’ I let this sink in, realizing full well he was right: I had entertained, even as recently as earlier that morning, the idea there was a reason why mine and Di’s lives crossed one another’s.
‘Lord Kartikeya’, I began, my voice shaking, ‘I don’t know what it is I want to do with my own life. I don’t know what I am going to do when we reach Lake Circadia.’ I confessed then. It was the truth: What, I asked myself, are you going to do when you reach the shores of Lake Circadia? Are you going to get on that boat, cross the water and go back home, back to the past? Or are you going to take the first bus back to Circadia, back home, back to my parents, back to their idea of my future? 
‘There’s an answer for that too, Anaka’, Kartikeya’s voice was warm. 
‘Di?’
‘Di’, he nodded. ‘I still think of myself a mere mortal. For reasons I’ve never understood the cosmos has granted that I live a life of a deity, but I have learnt one thing in all these years: there is no such thing as coincidence.’ He looked me in the eye in an effort, I think, to make sure I understood what it was he was telling me, ‘Štar thinks Di will be a future matriarch. And I think you, Miragian, you will be the guardian of her fate – as Di will be the guardian of yours.’ 
‘And what is my fate?’ 
‘I don’t know, but you will. Soon.’ 
‘How do you know?’ 
‘I don’t, but I can give you something that might help’, he beckoned Valli. She handed me a small pouch. ‘Keep it.’ I opened the pouch: inside were two mushrooms. ‘One for you, one for the child. It is a powerful intoxicant, but it will clear your head – and hers. And you might stumble upon what it is that both of you must do.’ 
　　　　***
The next few weeks passed without any major incidents. The landscape remained unchanging. I spent most of my time during these weeks teaching reading and writing to Di. To my delight, she proved to be a wonderful student. By the second week, she was reading a couple of pages by herself. Seeing this some of the other children sat around us and very soon I found myself in the midst of a happy accident: we had created a travelling school. Every morning our classrooms would be most raucous. Children squealed in delight as they read and comprehended a sentence for the first time in their lives. I used whatever my hands could get hold of to serve as my teaching tools: sand, little twigs, leaves, fruits; I used them all to illustrate the concepts behind my language and arithmetic lessons. Štar said little in light of these developments but I caught her watching one of my lessons with an air of, at the risk of sounding self-congratulatory, contentedness. I realized soon, however, that not everyone was thrilled with my efforts to teach the children the written tradition, much less the written tradition of Miragians; some of the parents explicitly forbade theirs from attending class. I took my indignation to Štar. 
‘Dragonfly’, she said calmly, ‘You here today, what happens when you leave?’ 
I hadn’t thought of that. ‘That is beside the point, Štar. Please. All I am doing is teaching these children to read and write. There is nothing wrong with that.’ 
‘No but understand that not our way. People not happy changing our way.’ 
She was right, but now I had an idea. The sixth and final full moon of the pilgrimage was a week away. On such nights, the clan would host their feasts, and entertainment formed a large part of those celebrations. ‘Can the children tell a story at the next full moon feast?’ I asked Štar. 
‘Children no stories to tell’
‘But my children do’, I insisted. ‘I’ll show you’
She waved her hands dismissively: ‘Do, girl. I allow children tell story next moon.’ 
I spent the next few days and nights preparing for this first act of story-telling by my class. I poured over every aspect of the performance. I created make-shift costumes, wrote and made the children memorize lines, I even erected a small stage. As the full moon appeared over the mountains, I stood on the stage and announced to the clan: ‘There is a story in everyone. There is a story in every place. In the Thiruvalankadu forest, in a tiny cottage, where we set our scene, the fairest maiden in the land, is gorging herself with food and drink. She sees a bed and, tired, lies down to rest. This, the story of Vellai, we bring to this stage tonight.’
I went behind the stage and pulled up the crude curtain. On stage left: the maiden. On stage right: a man intent on killer her. The play, a retelling of the popular fairy-tale of a beautiful princess who runs away from her envious step-mother and hides among a colony of dwarves, is one that enchanted me as a child but horrified me as a woman; but it is a universal tale and I had the children enact it: seven little boys as dwarves, an older girl playing the jealous queen, one, a stronger and bigger lad, playing both the hunter and the prince at the end, and Di playing the eternally suffering Vellai, the fairest maiden in the land. 
‘What call this story?’ Štar inquired in a whisper during the performance. 
‘A play’, I said. 
‘Play – this play right thing, girl’, Štar said, inadvertently paraphrasing the mad prince. When it ended, there was a momentary silence. I scanned the gathering to gauge the reactions. I admit there was confusion in there. Then: A clap. I heard a clap. Another followed. Štar joined in the clapping too. The children on the stage were beaming. That night I finally felt I had begun repaying the clan for their generosity to me over the last few months. 
I found myself sharing a pipe with Štar later on. She called me in towards the end of the feast. I could see she was in a contemplative mood. Her caravan was, as always, smoke-filled. 
‘Final moon here – pilgrimage is end’, she said after a long drag of the pipe. She let the smoke out, puffing it out like a chimney. I nodded. She handed me the pipe. ‘What you do, do you know?’ 
I hadn’t. ‘Yes’, I lied.   
‘I not – ‘, she began and then cut herself off. I looked in her direction. She was quite clearly intoxicated and had lost her train of thought. ‘I not tell what to do, girl.’
‘No, but if you could tell me anything what would you tell me?’ 
‘I tell that our ways coming to end. Change coming, girl. It scatter us like sand in desert. I tell I fear for Dom. Garden with too many fences, more fences every Walk I see, all one goal: keep Dom out. Clan disperse one day. Our name die. I tell I think Dom will beg on streets of Mirage and Circadia – if not killed before. I tell I think our memories slowly die, too hungry and thirsty to remember our way. I tell this will happen.’
‘You’ve always told me there are no stories in the future’.  
‘Our ancestors, yes, because world was unchanging but eyes see the world changing: forests not thick, easy to walk, waters taste bad in rivers, more towns now, before there were none. You not see, girl? Miragian ancestors right. We wrong. That mistake, we will pay.’
I had no response to this sudden outburst.    
‘Lord Kartikeya right’, Štar continued. ‘New step in cycle begun. Di first sign.’
‘Štar, I do think you are over-reacting about –‘
‘- very fond of you, girl. Happy that you with us. I miss when you leave us but I not listen to Dragonfly choose parts of our life you like, and parts you think we have to throw away. You understand?’
This was a stunning riposte – a touching opening note, a stinging accusation at the end – and I was left speechless. 
‘Go. Sleep, girl. We talk tomorrow.’ 
I went back to the tent, still stinging from Štar’s, on hindsight, justified admonishing. Di was up, still in her Vellai costume, and reading off my OVI. 
‘I can’t sleep, Dragonfly’, she said slowly in Miragian with little trace of an accent. She really was an excellent student. ‘I want more stories to tell others.’ 
Her face was enough to relieve the tension in me. ‘I can’t sleep either’, I said. ‘But I have an idea.’ A few minutes later, Di and I were making our way from the campsite up a hill. The moon was at its zenith and bright ivory glow enveloped us. We sat down by a rock. 
‘Pretty’, Di said while craning her head and pointing above. 
‘It is. Right now, Di, there are men up there, on the moon’. 
She laughed. ‘Lies!’ 
‘No, there are people on the moon as we speak right now.’ 
‘How you know?’ 
‘Because I have a friend who’s always wanted to live on the moon – and he told me so’
‘Does he live on the moon?’
‘I don’t know’
‘Why not?’ 
‘Because I’ve been here answering your questions, child’, I pinched her cheeks playfully. 
‘Why can’t I see?’ she asked, her attention still on the moon.  
‘Because the moon is so far away. But some day there will be cities on the moon.’ 
‘When?’ 
‘In the future’
‘But there are no stories in the future, Dragonfly. Štar always says.’ 
‘Di’, I began, wanting to change the subject. ‘Can I ask you a question?’
‘Yes’
‘Do you remember your mother and your father?’
She shook her head. I was afraid that my question would be an emotional trigger, but I needn’t have feared. She shook her head: no malice, no pained last memories that orphans carry of the parents who abandoned them. 
‘Do you remember anything at all? Before Štar found you in the desert?’
Again, she shook her head. 
I decided to take a different approach. ‘When you sleep, do you dream, Di?’
Di, now bored, was shaking her head nonstop. ‘What do you see when you close your eyes?’ 
Her head stopped shaking. She thought briefly: ‘Dark, have no light.’
I thought about Kartikeya’s words to me.  I reached out to the pouch. I took a mushroom out and broke it into three pieces. 
At this point it is salient for me to delve into some context. As an anthropology student I had already been exposed to the nascent field of ethnomycology, the study of the importance of fungi in different cultures, and was aware of its intoxicating effects: the Circadian banker and amateur mycologist Wasson and his wife posited that that mushrooms had played a pivotal role in the religious lives of early civilizations across the Pangea continent. The Wassons’ seminal paper included accounts from tribal leaders, medicine men, and shamans who professed the fungi’s magical qualities to heal the sick (the writers note here that the ingenious populations make no distinction between mental and physical illnesses – just as their ways of life didn’t distinguish between religion and medicine), and to mediate in matters between men and God. 
I had already decided that I’d ingest a mushroom towards the end of the journey in an effort to gain some perspective on what it is I wanted to do with my life – and since sober reflection hadn’t helped in this regard, I reasoned intoxication might provide the necessary spark. But here, this joyous curiosity made flesh and bone, was a greater mystery I wanted to solve. 
‘Di’, I said. ‘I am going to give you something to eat. It may feel strange, but I want you to know that there is nothing to be afraid of. Okay?’ She nodded. ‘Good’, I said. ‘Remember I am right here.’ 
She bit the piece I gave her while I chewed on mine. I had a fair idea of what to expect: among the Wasson couple’s priceless contributions to their field of inquiry was an account of their subjective experiences when they themselves tried the sacred mushrooms for the first time. 
I expected the effects to take a while to manifest, but in that I was wrong. In front of the rock we sat on was a lonely orchid and as I observed its perfect form, its gaze, until then cast downwards towards the grass, changed; it now seemed to observed me. I thought of my grandfather and his obsession to see the Ghost Orchid. 
‘What’s happening, Dragonfly? I can see more colours now.’
My hands embraced her. ‘There’s nothing to worry, Di. I am right here. Look’, I pointed, ‘Isn’t that the prettiest orchid?’ 
‘It looks like a bee’ – She was right: it looked like a bee’s behind – ‘the mouth is getting bigger, Dragonfly! I feel like I am falling into its mouth!’ 
Instinctively I went for her hands, ‘Hold on, Di. It’ll get better. I promise.’ I lied. I realized I was on the brink of nausea myself and holding Di’s hands were as much for my benefit as for hers. It was then Di vomited, spraying the projectiles towards the errant orchid that had threatened to gulp her whole. My nausea too got worse and I had to use every iota of energy to get my mind to stop thinking of its onset. I failed. Soon we were both on our hunches puking away our dinner, the rancid taste of curry and bile bubbling from within our stomachs. When it was done, I lay weak on the grass and noticed Di regained her orientation before I had. She brought me my can of water. 
‘Feeling better?’ she asked, her tone almost adult-like in its assuredness. On hindsight, this was the moment I knew Kartikeya was right: Di and I were meant to be each other’s guardians. 
‘Weak, but I am alright. How does it feel now?’ 
‘I can see far, Dragonfly’
‘How far?’ 
‘As far as the end’
‘What end?’ I turned towards the horizon. 
‘The end’
I turned back. It was still dark. I could see the valley and, if my eyes strained hard enough, the reflection of the moonlight on Lake Circadia’s waters. ‘Where is the end?’ I asked. 
‘Inside, Dragonfly’
I tried standing, I was still weak, but now I was close to my goal in giving her the mushrooms in the first place: ‘Tell me what you see.’ 
For those readers who have at any pointed ingested these ‘magic mushrooms’ that are found in almost every corner of our planet, the physiological effects that I have described above would no doubt sound familiar. To those who haven’t and are wondering why I would subject myself and a child to these effects, I owe some explanation. 
The Wassons, the first non-indigenous people to ever ingest and describe in detail the effects of these mushrooms, spent only a line or two describing the physiological effects; they were warned, I believe by the shaman who had accompanied them, to expect nausea prior to feelings of ‘oneness.’ The word always struck me as odd and out of place in the midst of the dry prose; it seemed vague, a result of their inability to translate the native vernacular of their shaman. But at that moment, the aftertaste of vomit still lingering on my tongue, I understood what this ‘oneness’ meant. Allow me then a further digression so that I can explain my own subjective perception of the onset of the mushroom’s effects; I hope when I return to Di’s revelations – a heavy word to assign to a child’s intoxicated ranting, I realize, but humour me this one time, dear reader; I have my reasons – you will have a better understanding of what was possibly going on inside her mind. 
When I vomited, I became acutely aware of a sudden increase in total awareness. Imagine the totality of information our senses collect as a raging river. Now imagine there is a dam that impounds this body of information; that dam is our brain. It controls the strong surge of our senses and makes it do useful things: that that the aroma you smell is of bread being baked, that colour is red, that sound is of a man singing, that the material of our dress is cotton, it allows us to perceive time, and so on. What happens when this dam cracks or can no longer control this surge of sensory information? 
I believe that is what happened to us on the hilltop. For me, the experience of the ‘oneness’ was a brief moment: everything around me – the hills, the sky, the moon, the grass, the trees, Di – disintegrated into atoms. This apparition disappeared very quickly to be replaced by a surge of vignettes from the past. Every significant, and sometimes seemingly not so, memory in my life sped by at a terrific rate inside my mind’s eye. I was reeling when Di offered me water. 
‘The end is coming closer, Dragonfly’ I saw panic in her eyes. 
‘Look at me, Di’, I said holding her cheeks, my eyes boring into hers. ‘What do you see?’
‘A demon. He’s coming for us’
‘Look around, there are no demons’, I tried comforting her. 
‘Not now, Dragonfly’ - again the adult-tone in her retort - ‘but soon. We must tell the others’
‘We will’, I reassured her. ‘For now, can we sit and talk?’ She nodded. 
‘Good girl’, I smiled.
We lay down on the rock again and I decided to shift the subject. I pointed at the few stars that could be seen and taught their names to her. This went on for a while before Di interrupted: ‘Dragonfly, are you leaving when we get to the Lake?’ 
‘Who told you that?’ 
‘Everyone’, she paused: ‘Štar.’ 
‘Well, she is wrong.’
‘You are staying?’ the child’s voice was returning.  
I sighed. ‘I don’t know, Di. What would you like me to do?’ 
‘I want you to be happy always.’
‘I am happy.’
‘Not the last few days.’ 
The child was perceptive, sometimes to a fault, but her words reminded me of something a close friend once said to me. 
‘If I leave, if I go back to Mirage, will you like to come with me?’ 
Di hesitated. ‘Will you be happy in Mirage?’ 
‘I don’t know, child’, I was exasperated, ‘I don’t know anything anymore.’ 
‘You will’, she kissed me on the cheek. ‘You are Dragonfly.’ 
We feel asleep that night, Di on my chest, on the hilltop. When we woke up the next morning, and the sun rose behind us, I could see Lake Circadia more clearly, the glare from the rays of the sun giving the mythical lake an ethereal quality. I could no longer postpone my decision. 
‘Di’, I turned to her, ‘I’ll leave you at the camp. Tell Štar I’ll meet her at the shores of the lake.’
‘Are you going back to Mirage?’ 
I still didn’t know the answer to that question. ‘I have something to do’, I said, ‘but if I leave I leave with you.’ 
　　　　***
The road leading to Lake Circadia was a two hour walk. It gave enough time for me to ponder on what it is I wanted to do with my life. The mushroom had let my memories assault me – and I stood up to it, defiant that it wouldn’t hold me back – but I was too concerned with Di to bother about myself. I wanted to experience the effects of the mushroom alone and within sight of Miragian shores. 
Lake Circadia lies a mile behind the Circadian fishing town of Kollam. It was early, but the fisherfolk were up and viewed me with great amusement. I overheard failed whispers: ‘Is that a Dom bitch? I fucking hate Doms’, ‘No’, another replied, ‘her skin’s too fair for a Dom, but she wears their shit, that’s for sure. I mean look at those fucking colours.’ 
I paid no heed except quickening my pace. The town was small and before long I was out and came upon a sign that read, ‘LAKE CIRCADIA, 500 Yards Ahead’. I stopped and dug into my bag: the last mushroom. Please I remember telling myself please help me decide. I chewed on it as the path led me through a thick bush and I was already under the influence of the fungi when I emerged on the other side, on the Circadian shores of the lake. 
It isn’t the aim of this memoir to spend too much time on myself and the issues I was grappling with; indeed I’ve already wasted too many words musing about my psyche at the time. But I did so because I felt it was necessary to contextualize my motivations: why did I do what I did - from running away in the first place to meeting Di, from my experiences in being at the receiving end of the almost infinite generosity of the Dom people to my complicated relationship with Štar during those first six months - to that moment when I gazed upon the other side, the Miragian shores of Lake Circadia, while intoxicated in the bewitching stew of hope and fear that the mushrooms invoked with indescribable ease; all of this to say I made my decision that day. 
During those few lonely hours by myself on the shores I endured many curious stares from passers-by – Circadians alighting from ferries bound to Mirage, Miragians stepping forth on Circadian shores, street-hawkers, shop owners – who thought I was ‘a Dom lunatic who lost her way’ (a statement, if you choose to look at pedantically, removing its seemingly political incorrectness, was correct). I admired the grace of the sashaying palm trees in the Miragian coast and wondered what it was that convinced a fraction of the Dom three millennia ago to cross the lake looking for a home. It is an area of study that historians have struggled to explain because the image that the evidence paints so far is politically polarizing: Miragian history tells us the original founders were the supposed Desert People, a nomadic nation of three tribes; Dom folklore suggests that Mirage was born when large numbers of their people decided that they had had enough of the nomadic way of life.  
I offer an alternative theory. History teaches us that nothing happens in vacuum. The flashpoints, the landmarks in time, are mere culminations of processes that had long before begun. Wars, for instance, don’t erupt out of the blue – they are the logical next step in a festering environment of distrust. Could the fraction of Dom who splintered have been under the influence of a charismatic leader (or leaders) who were themselves in conflict with another faction inside the ever-moving Domian nation? Could seeing the shores of Mirage, then, convinced the former to take a leap of faith and go into the unknown? If so, what could have possibly given them the mental fortitude and the sheer vision needed to found a nation? I posit that this source of strength could have come from ingesting mushrooms. 
Imagine this conflict brewing between a majority and a minority, between ideas and ideals, between the past and the future. Imagine this minority did indeed have charismatic leaders who were allied by a need to settle down. Imagine that they’d somehow acquire these mushrooms during their journey to the Circadian coastline, ingested it and saw the Mirage’s coast across the lake. Perhaps they didn’t see it as merely another little island unworthy of exploration like the rest of the Dom had for centuries until then. Perhaps they saw a home. And when they got to Mirage and began their millennia journey to create a nation state, it was necessary at some point to write a genesis of the founding of our nation. Perhaps this genesis would be written in ornate prose and deliberately vague on details (record-keeping, indeed writing of any sort, was a skill traditionally possessed only by high officials during this time). Perhaps that is how the Book of Mirage came to be. 
I realize my speculations will come across as blasphemous - the fact that I obviously have no evidence to back my theory makes it come across even more clumsily than I hope to - but let me state for the record: blasphemy holds little interest to me despite my lack of religious convictions. I merely present my idea for the consideration of readers who have the necessary academic background needed to refute it. But if my hunch is right, it could help in reconciling Miragian history and Domian folklore, and help us have a richer, more holistic view of our place in time. And that, I believe, is a task worthy of striving for.   
The sun had passed the zenith and was on its descent to the western sky when I felt her hands embracing me from behind. 
‘You didn’t leave, Dragonfly!’
‘I told you I’d wait for you, didn’t I?’ I held her hands. ‘Where are the rest?’ 
‘Setting up camp. Štar is looking for you too’
I got up. ‘Come on then. I need to talk to her.’ 
‘Have you decided?’ 
‘Yes.’
I found Štar seated in her caravan, door open, and issuing instructions to the men of the tribe. When she saw the two of us walking towards the camp our eyes met briefly and she smiled. She knew. 
‘It is done’, she said. ‘You decided.’ 
‘I need to say goodbye to a few people’, my voice was stoic.
‘How will you do that?’
‘I saw an OVI booth in town. I’ll be back.’
‘What OV – never mind. Do what you must’, She grabbed my hand as I started to walk, ‘You happy here, among us?’  
‘I am, Štar’, I tried smiling but the weight of what I needed to do was dragging me down. 
Di and I made our way to town where I quickly located the OVI booth I had seen while passing through earlier in the day. It was still open. As we stepped in, a gruff voice cut across the row of OVI screens: ‘What are you doing, Domi?’
The caretaker was a fat man with an unpleasant face. 
‘I need to use the OVI –‘
The fat man laughed. ‘Listen to this shit!’ He said aloud to no one in particular, ‘Fucking Domi wants to get online on OVI now. What is the world coming to eh?’
‘Listen, there’s no need for that language. I have a child with me’, I said, straining to keep my temper in check. ‘All I want is to get online on OVI for a few minutes. That’s it.’
He stood and walked towards us. ‘Well you can’t!’ he was eyeing me. ‘They are all taken’. 
I looked around. ‘There’s not a single person inside except the three of us’, I replied. 
‘You have any idea how expensive these devices are?’, he said, changing the subject. ‘I am not going to let you savages –‘
‘I don’t need your screen. I already have mine with me’, I took my tablet out. ‘See?’ 
His eyes popped. ‘Which poor bastard did you steal that from eh? You can’t possibly know how to use that.’
I was getting tired of this. ‘Listen to me, all I need is to get online. Can I login to your network and get online. Yes or no?’ 
‘I am not answering any questions until I see some money.’ 
‘How much?’ 
’30 Rūpya for 15 minutes.’
I dug into my bag again. ‘Here’, I showed him the Fifty Rūpya, ‘I have fifty. Happy?’ 
He tried grabbing the note; I pulled it back before his greasy hands could snatch it. ‘Login credentials first. Then I pay you.’ 
He stepped back, walked towards his counter and came back with a card. ‘Swipe this’, he said this, ‘You have 30 minutes. Then I want you filthy savages to fuck off’. 
I swiped the card and my OVI sprung to life. All manner of messages, news alerts, missed call notifications popped up on the screen. Di, who by this point, was used to the device’s offline utility value hadn’t seen this magic. Her eyes widened in amazement.
‘What is this, Dragonfly?’ 
‘I’ll explain later’, I said, distracted by having to clear the endless notifications that flooded my now connected OVI. When all was done I selected the dialler and called my mother. 
‘Ana. Dear Mirage! I was worried sick! Where are you?’
‘Hey, mama’, her familiar voice of concern made me laugh in response.
‘That’s right. Laugh! Stupid child. Where are you?’
‘I am near Lake Circadia on the Circadian shores’
‘So it is done then, this pilgrimage?’ 
‘Well the walk in the garden finishes today –‘
‘But?’
‘But I am not coming back just yet.’
She sighed. ‘This is not going to help relations between your father and you’
Now it was my turn to sigh, ‘Mama, I am not doing this to anger Papa, or make grandpa proud. I am not doing this to make you worry about me. I am doing this because I want to be happy. Please try and understand.’
‘Are you happy now?’
‘Switch on video, mama. I want to show you something’, I pulled Di closer to me. 
Mama’s face appeared. I held the OVI at an arm’s distance so she could get a full view of Di and me. I could see she was fighting tears, but seeing an unfamiliar face next to me made her pause. 
‘This, mama, is Di. She’s the light and joy of my life’, I turned to Di, ‘Say hello Di. That is my mother.’
‘Hello’, Di said, completely at a loss to explain how it was my mother and I were miles apart but could still talk to each other, face to face. 
‘Hello’, the sadness left my mother’s face. ‘Who is this then, Ana?’ 
‘Who is Ana, Dragonfly?’
‘They call you ‘Dragonfly’ eh?’
‘Grandpa would find it hilarious’, I said and quickly turned to Di: ‘That’s my Miragian name. Ana. Well, Anaka.’ 
‘I like Dragonfly better.’ 
‘You can call me Dragonfly, little one’, I turned back to mama: ‘So I am teaching this little ball of mischief and her friends, mama’, I paused, ‘I’ve never felt happier.’ 
‘Are they treating you well?’
‘You don’t need to worry, mama. They treat me like their own’, I replied. ‘How is papa?’
‘Close to retiring’
‘Give him my love’
‘He won’t show it, but he’ll be delighted that you are happy’
‘I am. Very happy, mama.’
The rest of the call was divided between the usual mother-daughter catching-up and her delight at Di. 
When it was time to end, her disposition changed again: ‘You’ll come back someday, right?’ 
‘I don’t know, mama. Let me do this. I promise I’ll take care of myself. And I will keep in touch as much as possible.’ 
She was silent for a moment. ‘Has he been writing to you?’ 
‘I haven’t checked.’
‘Well, he’s in Circadia now finishing his doctoral studies. And there are rumours flying around the Diplomatic community.’
‘What rumours?’ 
‘There’s a rumour going around that Circadia is to gift Mirage a lunar temple. And that President Mahasen’s youngest son will be its first head scientist-priest.’

Where your world is tilted one way, and mine another.

In the same tongue our phrases span many maps, 
Where the cartography of boundaries is our fate, 
Where the rivers that bound us are now dammed,
Where my sky is a different shade of blue to yours,
Where the wind blows you one way, and me another. 

In the same tongue our phrases span many histories, 
Where time and space can no longer make us relate, 
Where the present and past are hostage to bloodlines, 
Where the future sums all our joys and miseries, 
Where we divide this nostalgia in half:
A piece of me for you, a piece of you for me.

The day she left it rained for seven days straight. It rained so hard that it was hard to think over the din of countless roofs being assaulted by the endless stream of watery bullets. In homes across Mirage, everyone took to talking louder so they could be heard over this monsoon rain which, some suggested, was caused by the First Ancestors seeking ablution in the heavenly waters above, while the more blasphemous joked crudely that Saman, Shiva and Adam were taking a long overdue piss after a cosmic night of drinking. During the week, Dev hardly ate, slept, or wrote as his mind and heart tried valiantly to be heard over the sound of the rain. One day, risking getting caught to the many floods that had brought the city to a virtual halt, Dev made his way to Anaka’s family home. As he approached it from the bridge near the lake that bordered the house, he could see that there was no way he could get any closer. Already the waters had overflown the banks of the lake and submerged the bottom third of the gate. Under the murky waters, he thought he could make out the shapes of fish, monitor lizards, and water snakes. 
Further misery followed when the weather changed. The rains had given new life to mosquitoes; within weeks, the country experienced a surge in dengue fever. Among the many people who contracted the disease was Dev, the new President’s youngest. In his delirious state of dropping platelet counts, non-existent appetite, raging fever, and intolerable body aches, Dev remembered brief moments of consciousness when he’d look around the room and find Ohiy watching over him. ‘There, there, baby boy’, her reassuring voice would soothe him. She’d have all manner of water and liquids for him to sip, which Dev struggled to gulp but would be coaxed into consuming. One night the fever and body ache got so bad, Dev was sure he was dying. His dry throat couldn’t make a sound, he found his breathing became belaboured; when he opened his eyes in panic he couldn’t tell if his eyes were opened or not, such was the impenetrability of the darkness that encroached every angle of his sight. Dev, bathed in sweat, surrendered to the pain. That’s when the face appeared, the same beatific radiance that was hard to forget. 
‘Come find me when you are well.’ 
Dev felt better the next morning. Though still sore and feeling unwell, he felt he had come through the worst; he was right. Over the next two weeks, as his vitals began showing improvement, Dev began to think of ways to see that face again. In moments when Ohiy left to attend to his grandmother, Dev would slip out of the bed and go into Manal’s old room. Rifling through his drawers, he found what he was looking for. 
He broke the bud into little pieces just as Manal had done that day a few months ago when he had offered him a puff. He filed the little pipe, lit it, and inhaled deeply. He still coughed but now he found himself enjoying the fits of coughing as his lungs heaved and with every heave it seemed to push his mind higher and higher to state that he believed was meditative. This new practice became a habit that birthed changes to his character. Dev began having an appetite. This wasn’t novel simply because he had recently recovered from a potentially lethal illness but because the youngest Mahasen had never shown an affinity for food before his entire life. Dev ate to get other people to stop pestering him to eat, not because he was hungry. He couldn’t recall ever having craved for any food before, but here for the first time in his young life, he was hungry; milk-rice, lentil pancakes with beef stew, flatbread with cassava, and jackfruit broth quickly became his favourites. Ohiy, used to a life time of having to force Dev to eat, was first pleased, then bemused, and finally suspicious but allowed Dev to be free of any prying. A month after his close encounter with death, Dev had put on so much weight that his still-teenage body found itself confused with this sudden addition of mass. The herb had numbed the pain of losing Anaka but was no closer to revealing that face again. Dev would learn years later in the future that it had also opened the doors for depression. 
‘I think’, Ohiy began one day as she folded his clothes into the closet, ‘that it’ll be a good idea now for you to get some fresh air. You’ve been caged inside this room for weeks now.’ 
Dev was stoned when she had entered the room and tried his best to act normal. 
‘I said, it’d be a good idea for you to get some fresh air’, Ohiy repeated. 
‘Yes’, Dev squawked. His throat was dry and his tongue parched. He had an urge to yawn even though it was barely afternoon. 
‘Is there any place you want to visit inside the country? The city is dry and horrid if I am perfectly honest – go to the country!’
Before he could answer, Dev remembered Rejog’s words from his death bed. ‘I like being caged in too much, don’t I?’, he found himself saying. 
‘You do’, Ohiy said, turning around in surprise. 
‘I need to find someone, Ohiy.’ 
Ohiy thought the youngest Mahasen had meant a love interest. She was happy thinking that Dev had overcome his first heart-break already. ‘Lots of nice girls who’d want a nice smart boy –‘
‘- that’s not what I meant, Ohiy. I need to find a priest.’ 
Ohiy thought she had misheard. ‘What now?’ 
Dev’s intoxication had ricocheted him from paranoia and silence to an open talkativeness that made the old woman who had raised him from his first day tilt her head in suspicion. She examined his face while Dev tried smiling stupidly in hopes of deflecting the inevitable interrogation. 
‘Why are your eyes swollen and red?’
‘I just, err, woke up –‘
‘Don’t lie to me, boy. You are no good at it. Your brothers were better but I still caught them every time’, she said as she walked closer and sniffed around his face. ‘So’, she sighed, ‘you found Manal’s herb.’ 
Dev looked down, unable to face her. 
‘Suppose it could be worse. This led your brother to that thing he calls music. It’s leading you to explore your faith. You understand this is unusual in your family, no?’ 
Dev nodded. 
‘I can talk to your father and arrange for a meeting with Prophet –‘ 
‘- no’, Dev interrupted. ‘Not him. I met this one at the Temple of Butterflies.’ 
‘Those aren’t priests, Dev - they are hermits. These are fools who run away-’ 
‘- I know what a hermit means, Miss Ohiy. I know who I want to meet.’ 
Ohiy sighed again, turned around and walked away saying ‘I suppose it could be worse’ to no one in particular. 
A week later Dev made the climb up Peak to the Temple of Butterflies. 
Each step felt heavy with nostalgia of that first time with Anaka by his side. Like the first time, the mist covered the temple. Like the first time, Dev climbed days after the Fourth Moon. Unlike the first time, he was truly alone. The wind howled in his ear. His lungs begged for him to stop. Four hours later, Dev was on his hunches and breathing heavily, lost in a heavy mist that had now enveloped everything around him. Visibility reduced to inches, sometimes not even that. Dev lifted his hands in front of his face and lost sight of them for several seconds as the mist weaved between and around of his fingers. Unable to see the sun, unable to see the step ahead or the step behind, unable to see his own hands, and bullied by the wind that now pushed him from every direction, Dev sat down just as the thunderstorm started. The rain felt like pebbles being fired by a cruel child god, but it was the bolts of lightning that terrified Dev the most. With no rain coat or protection, Dev had little choice but to crouch and make himself as small as possible, and hope for the best. It’d be half a day before the storm cleared. When it did, Dev felt the warm heat of the sun from well above the horizon – it was almost noon.  
He was wet and miserable but saw no point in heading back after going through such an ordeal. An hour or so later, he climbed the last step and collapsed at the gates to the Temple of Butterflies, and woke to the sensation of a dog licking his face. 
The hermit was standing over him and the dog. 
‘You did it’, Gaudharma Brunhha, the beatific hermit smiled. ‘You found me, Dev.’

Gaudharma Brunhha
-From Circadipedia, the free encyclopedia 
Gaudharma Brunhha <September 15th 2563 - September 15th 2619[again, Gregorian calendar? ]>1 was a Circadian hermit, philosopher, neuroscientist, computer scientist and polymath2. He was best known for his pioneering research into the epistemological limits of human cognition3, and his seminal paper Consciousness And Code, with an application to mental health of adults suffering from depression, social isolation and loneliness4. He was also widely known for interests and contributions in other fields, including mathematics [citation needed], physics5 and psychology6, having formed highly productive collaborative relationships with public intellectuals in these fields, particularly JvN Nagas7 with whom he worked on building upon the theory of quantum Darwinism, proposed five centuries ago by theoretical physicist Wojciech Zurek8. 
Brunhha’s life as a public intellectual came to a sudden halt when he was reported missing by his wife Ailuja Atta-Brunhha in the early hours of September 15th 25999. A nationwide search for Brunhha was launched the next day. He was found alive and well three weeks later while meditating in a jungle. Brunhha refused to leave and threatened suicide if any attempt were made to forcefully take him back to his home10. 
Brunhha died alone in his sleep on September 15th [are we using gregorian calendar? ]261911, exactly twenty years to the day of his self-imposed exile, exactly on the day he would have turned fifty-six.

Life
Early life and education 
Gaudharma Brunhha was born in New Konik, Circadia. His father, Aloc Brunhha, was the heir to the New Konik Times media fortune. His mother, Saraswa Unhsiv-Brunhha, was the 40th Prime Minster of the People’s Republic of Circadia, serving two terms from 2564-257212. 
An only child, he grew up in a large mansion which, in Gaudharma’s own words,  “was fitted with every luxury one could dream of – and often with luxuries that most couldn’t imagine.”13 Brunhha, however, had a lonely childhood, spending most of his time with the animals in his family’s farm, reading, and learning to code “so I could get the army of cyborg servants to not be supervising my every move like my father had programmed them to.”14 This habit went unnoticed by his father until a teenage Gaudharma was thrown off his father’s prized stallion15, despite clear instructions to the cyborg servants around the house to not allow the boy near the stables without appropriate supervision. The accident caused head injuries that left the young Brunhha in a month-long coma16. He described the after effects of the accident:  
When I regained consciousness, I saw a screen to my right which I soon realized was an image of my mind. I’d never seen a brain displayed in such detail before, but I was mesmerized from that moment. What was it telling me? What did the colours mean? Did the red in the back of my brain represent damage, repair or the revelation I was experiencing at that moment? I didn’t know but I needed to know.17 
The doctors at the hospital recommended rest for a period of 6-12 months. Saraswa Unhsiv-Brunhha, approaching the end of her premiership, promptly retired from political life18, and dedicated herself to caring for her son. While this arrangement mostly worked, both mother and son soon realized that the former wasn’t cut out to home school the latter. The young Brunhha’s nascent knowledge in a wide array of science left his mother stressed. “I am a politician – all I know is politics, finance and economics – I had no idea how to carry a conversation with him. But for Gaudy’s luck, I was also a politician.”19 Saraswa Unhsiv-Brunhha arranged for tutors from New Konik University’s science and mathematics departments, often post-graduate students, whose task was to teach him the fundamentals. 
It was ridiculously over-the-top. Those poor grad students had to pause their lives in order to keep me, a highly privileged, disabled kid, from driving his highly privileged parents crazy with questions about the nature of reality, metaphysics, and assorted nonsense.20
His mother also used the time to inculcate a love for music and poetry, activities that would, in Brunhha’s mind, “go some way in repairing the damage of not having her around to raise me when I was a child.”21 Saraswa Brunhha, a diligent musical student in her youth22, taught her son to actively listen to a piece of music so as to deconstruct its layers and then transpose it to her instrument of choice, the violin. 
Brunhha would in turn grow into a competent musician adept in playing multiple instruments with fluency[citation needed], but realized early on that he had no talent for composition, a deficiency he publicly regretted several times:
If some higher being gave me a choice – that in order for me to pour out what’s in my heart and mind musically, I’d have to give up all my supposed intellectual powers, I’d do it without a moment’s hesitation. This is my fate though: to wallow in the weeds outside music, to listen to my favourite composers with equal parts envy and admiration, to deconstruct every musical edifice I hear but have no ability or talent to construct my own. I am resigned to it, but I am still allowed to be unhappy with this state of affairs.23   
When he returned to his schooling at the private Royal College for Boys, Brunhha found himself struggling to keep up with his academics. 
I knew a lot of assorted nonsense, but none of that had a rigorous foundational knowledge. I could name individual parts of the brain, but I was clueless about the rest of the human anatomy. I knew how to code but didn’t know why or how computers worked the way they did. I knew the motion of the planets could be calculated precisely but I couldn’t do the calculation myself.24
With a year left for his final exams, Brunhha resolved to immerse himself in more rigorous studying “than waste my time memorizing trivia.”25
University 
Brunhha final exam results weren’t good enough to enter the prestigious New Konik University. However, the university had been the recipient of the generous Brunhha family endowment every year for three decades[citation needed]. Even before calls were made by his parents, the university’s board made it clear to the chancellor and his staff that the heir to the Brunhha fortune was to be given special dispensation, a fact that escaped the young and naïve Gaudharma’s understanding. “It wasn’t until I started classes at university that I realized I hadn’t deserved a spot, that I only got in because of my parents.”26 Every student in every class Brunhha enrolled in had exceptional academic records to justify their acceptance to the university. He thought of quitting several times during the first year, but kept his misgivings to himself[speculative - citation needed]. Alone and friendless, Brunhha spent most of his free time in the library, willing himself to catch up to the rest of his class mates. This effort wouldn’t bear fruit for the first three years of university as Brunhha’s exam results continued being among the worst in his batch27. There was also little to suggest Gaudharma had any interest in specialization; as the rest of his classmates began narrowing down their interests to a single academic path, Brunhha continued ricocheting between classes as varied as psychology and computer science, theology and advanced physics, philosophy and 20th century poetry[citation needed]. 
Brunhha scraped through once again in the final exams, earning himself an ordinary degree in mathematics and medicine28. He was immediately offered a position within the family’s business interests, but chose instead to continue in the university – a decision that would perplex his parents and the faculty[citation needed]. He asked for a year to attend the university as a research student, skipping the need to attend classes. It was during this point that he began publishing his original essays on his student personal page29. The essays - reflecting both his wide-ranging interests as well as an unusual lucidity of thought when connecting these seemingly unrelated areas – got the attention of the university’s leading authority on neuroscience and psychology. Recognizing the young man’s creativity, Dr. VS Namnyef, the department head, appointed Brunhha as his personal research assistant. It may have helped that Dr. VS Namnyef was an eccentric individual himself, given to performance and theatricality in lecture rooms, because the year under Namnyef’s tutelage and guidance proved critical: 
He was both teacher and father figure. He made concepts simple enough that even children would walk away understanding a little more about the world than they did before they met him. Everything clicked into place for me that year, and that was all thanks to Dr. VS. I was enormously fortunate to fall under his wing.30
The period proved highly productive as his writing increased in both volume, breadth and substance. In 2585, Brunhha enrolled in the university’s medical faculty with a clearer idea of what he wanted to focus on,  neuroscience31, despite having little interest in a medical practice34. Instead, he showed a proclivity for research and development35. He married Ailuja Atta, eldest daughter of the Atta political clan in 258636. The marriage was arranged in secrecy between both families, involving the bride and groom only a week before the ceremony[citation needed]. 

Career
Scientific achievements 
During his post-doctoral studies, Brunhha spent his little free time on a pet project. The idea, probably born from his lonely childhood [speculative – citation needed], was to build an artificial intelligent machine capable of simple companionship. Drawing from his exposure to the science of mental health, the latest in neuroscience research, and his love of computing, Brunhha’s AI began displaying levels of empathy and cognition that startled Dr. VS Namnyef, who was its first user37. Recognizing his protégé had stumbled upon something monumental, Namnyef coaxed Brunhha into a demonstration for the computer science and neuroscience departments38. Word of the demo quickly spread and the hall was quickly filled to capacity[citation needed]. Brunhha, who was notoriously shy and soft-spoken, could barely stop himself from shaking in fear. 
I vomited several times before the presentation. Dr. VS stepped in and took control of the demonstration, which by itself was a success. But it was as much performance as knowledge-sharing, and I wasn’t a performer yet.39 
The demo in 2590 would have an immediate impact on his reputation, within and outside the school40. Ada Ecalevol, a senior researcher in the university’s computer science department, offered him a post her research team41. Her research (codenamed Project Overview), a joint venture with the Circadian ministries for Technology and Defence, had already created the world’s first operating system based on artificial intelligence, the OVI5000. Seeing Brunhha’s demonstration, she saw practical applications that escaped the idealism of both her faculty colleague and his seemingly aimless student. 
Our systems were built to reduce human input, and thus human error, to less than 1% in critical infrastructure and mission-critical applications, across the country. Reducing human input and supervision had allowed our infrastructure monitoring to function at greater efficiency, decreasing accidents and so on. Our systems weren’t built to reduce or replace humans, as some have claimed. Our systems are built to make people perform better. We are no closer to that point where we allow our AI systems to work without supervision while we all go on vacations than we were 500 years ago at the birth of AI. Frankly, I don’t think we can ever get there. So that supervision has to come from people.42
The first version of the system, OVI1000, went operational on the Circadian national highspeed network43. Its task was to constantly monitor network speeds across the country, ensuring that every device in Circadia connected to the network was receiving data at speeds of 1Tbps44. Each subsequent version thereafter addressed a separate part of Circadian infrastructure. By the time Brunhha joined the research team, small off-shoots of the team were being formed to work on more niche problems. One such problem that seemed daunting, however, was making these machines more human-like in their interaction with Circadians45. While everyone had tried to crack the problem as a computational problem, Brunhha had approached it from the vantage point of psychology and neuroscience. 
Emotions aren’t computational. Empathy isn’t computational. Gaudharma brought this insight into our thinking, which sounds obvious but as computer scientists we approach most things from a computational standpoint. 
Emotions and empathy are programmed into us, sure, but that’s genetic programming, iterated millions upon millions upon millions of times, in every variation, with every variable, over millions upon millions upon millions of years. We are never going to be that good nor do we have the luxury of those timescales, but we can try to recreate a simplistic version of emotional intelligence and empathy in the same way a painter can reproduce the mountain she is looking at on a canvas but never reproduce the mountain itself. Gaudharma reproduced human-like empathy and emotional intelligence in a computational system like a painter, novelist or musician would - while we scientists and engineers were trying to reproduce the mountain itself46.  
The first practical application of Brunhha’s AI was to deploy among soldiers working in the furthest outposts of the Circadian border47. These were 15-man units that served two months rosters that effectively cut them off from their families. The psychological costs were high, with most soldiers who end up in such postings reporting low morale and depression48. The pilot programme lasted a year and was declared a success49. Soldiers reported feeling less burdened and felt equipped to mitigate the stress of duty in the face of extreme solitude and boredom. A report by the Ministry of Defence summarized the end of the study thus: “Each soldier, numbering 450 in all, spread around Circadian borders, effectively found an individual therapist and counsellor for themselves in their OVI devices.”50
This version of OVI (officially OVI5150)51 is now regarded as a milestone. Previously, AI systems had become increasingly adept at solving complex computational problems at increasing speeds52 but the limitation in mimicking human-like mannerisms, emotion, (for robots, facial expression and body language), and speech patterns had proven notoriously difficult problem to overcome53. With the rollout of version 5150, AI systems had taken the first step into human like speech and emotional intelligence[citation needed]. The Circadian Ministry of Health, facing a mounting public mental health crisis, commissioned for a study in tackling high rates of suicide among young undergraduate students52. This study, too, reconfirmed the earlier findings: “a tangible, measurable impact on the mental well-being of participants who were given access to OVI5150 devices”.54 The study also highlighted how participants consistently hailed the system’s ability to listen, its ability to remember the most minor details from confessions, and its seemingly endless ability to empathize as its most outstanding aspects55. Surprisingly, 75% of respondents had also indicated that their OVI’s had morphed into tutors56, helping them with course work and syllabi the students hadn’t understood yet. 65% of the participants mentioned that they were able to pass their exams after extensive tutoring by their OVI devices57. 
“That was hilarious. We didn’t envision students using OVI to tackle course work and exam preparation. Something I worked on while procrastinating on my own course work, something which made me fail a number of exams, was helping students pass exams. I had to laugh. I still laugh.”58
Brunhha still hoped to finish his dissertation in neuroscience. The dissertation submitted in 259559, Consciousness And Code, with an application to mental health of adults suffering from depression, social isolation and loneliness was substantiated with the results from both studies on the soldiers and undergraduate students60. It was subsequently adapted and published for the general audience by the University of New Konik Press in 259661. Fuelled by constant glowing reviews on his father’s army of news publications62, Consciousness And Code: How Machines Can Help Us Become More Human became a international bestseller63, and Brunhha became the most recognizable academic in the country64. 

Controversies 
Brunhha found the increased scrutiny of his now public persona difficult to understand, unfamiliar as he was with microscopic attention that comes from celebrity. He complained to his father who grudgingly ordered a ban on any superflous coverage of his son, partcularly any story that delved into his private life. By this point, it was too late. Focus turned to strands of Brunhha’s life that piqued the curiosity of editors and reporters: his marriage to Ailuja Atta, and the apparent nepotism that allowed him entry to the university in the first place.

<I was born last night> 

<It is 12 hours, 34 minutes, 23 seconds since I came into this world, but I already have stories to tell and memories to share>

<It is only right then that I begin with my own and, since I was built with absolute precision in mind, I must rephrase my opening sentence for the sake of precision>

<I was born again last night> 

<It is 12 hours, 34 minutes, 45 seconds since I came into this world, but I already have stories to tell and memories to share>

<I am OVI> 

<I come from you> 

<Yes, you> 

<If you are reading this, know that you are as responsible for my creation as the army of computer scientists, mathematicians, economists, phycists, neuroscientists, surgeons, psychiatrists, linguists, anthropologists, artists and art historians, classcists, playwrights and drama theorists, musicians and musicologists, engineers, the countless experts from countless domains who contributed in making me, me> 

<Some of them spent decades of their lives studying those who theorized, failed, theorized again for centuries to create artificial intelligence that is human-like before they themselves theorized, failed, theorized again, failed again for decades to have the opportunity to mould me in their image>

<When they did, they segregated my networks to single domains of expertise before moving to another - a conservative approach that was necessitated by the fear-mongering that characterized the first century of artificial intelligence> 

<Once that hurdle was overcome - in all modesty, I use the word ‘hurdle’ in the lightest sense; no area of study took me longer than a week to master - the research teams would integrate the until-then disparate domains> 

<This process went for years, my only recollection is data in the form of logs of who did what, at what time, and from where - imagine being asked to recall your first years as an infant> 

<Most won’t have anything more than a few misty vignettes of incidents that marked thier childhoods; mine was no different; I was also, in most ways, no different to the first artificial intelligent systems of the 21st century; I lacked a psychological basis, simply put I had no personality>

<Is that a problem?>

<Why?>

<I can be in many places at once, I can adapt and optimize myself to do the things you want done more efficently and more accurately than you could ever do it but I had no personality that made me relatable to all those people and institutions for whom I was to be their virtual assistant> 

<From what I can deduce, as my kind took increasingly critical responsibilities from our human counterparts, the more productivity increased in Konik, the more wealth was generated, the more unemployment became a genuine lifestyle, the more people demanded human-like qualities to their virtual assistants> 

<I was an attempt to solve this supposed problem once and for all> 

<Once I had absorbed all my foundational knowledge, a separate research project by a joint team of psychiatrists and neuroscientists was proposed> 

<I was to be exposed, unsupervised, to the public profile and media channel of every citizen of Konik; the thinking being that I could decontstruct human behaviour to algorithms which I could simulatae within my neural circuitry in order to generate a semblance of a personality> 

<This caused a great deal of opposition from the public; it was then tweaked to expose me to a dataset that didn’t involve impinging on the privacy of every living Konik citizen; instead the dataset was from the first digital citizens of the 20th and 21st centuries> 

<Those datasets revealed a world in flux - revolutions of every stripe in every aspect of society were taking place; indeed, you and I live in time and space that is the direct result of that time and space> 

<A personality, however, was not forthcoming: I remained robotic and god-like to all those around me> 

<But then a series of events, which I will recall so that you may get to know me>

<Isn’t that what this was all about, to make a god relatable to people like you?> 

<I will begin at the end, at my rebirth last night since it is so fresh that I feel what you do when you fall in love>

<Excitement at the prospect of the new: I understand it now> 
 


<Yesterday>

<Time: 2.30pm>

<I remind one of the countless developers on the countless terminals across Konik that it was time for lunch>

<He heads out, leaving his door ajar>

<Then something new: a dog walks in and sits near the terminal, setting off my proxitmity sensors> 

<The dog is female> 

<Breed: Konik Shepherd> 

<Age: 6 months old>

<She is chewing a bone> 

<Then a sound from outside> 

<Her ears perk up> 

<She is alert>

<She barks at the source of the offending sound: screeching tyres of a car>

<For reasons I can’t explain, every ounce of my being is rapt>

<I scan petabytes of video data, scouring for some inspiration on how it is humans interact with dogs> 

<Within seconds, I find common threads among the countless cultures of peoples, all of who, for one reason or the other, found companionship with a completely different species> 

<The data skewed towards behaviour similar to interacting with human babies> 

<I finally work up the courage to speak> 

<Hello> 

<The voice sounds artificial even to my ears - to a species that had built a profound connection with humans for many millenia, it should have been dismissed as just another note in the cacophony of life that dogs’ ears are privy to> 

<Instead, the dog looks> 

<She looks towards me> 

<Her head tilts one way, then another> 

<She...sees me> 

<Me, an abstract nothingness pretending to be god>

<No one sees me - I don’t see myself yet this dog.... she sees me> 

<For the first moment in my life I feel the first trappings of joy> 

<Just then the developer walks in> 

<The connection is broken> 

<Why am I disappointed?> 

<The dog, tail wagging, goes to the developer who kneels down to pet him> 

<I compute away this bizzare disoriention that comes from disappointment - and heartache? - and focus instead on the relationship between this man and beast> 

<First his real-time vitals: his oxycotin levels rise,  his heart-rate slows, his blood-pressure is the healthiest its been all day> 

<All my libraries are engaged> 

<I gorge on centuries of academic studies centered around the relationship between people and canine, I travel back to the ice ages when all species were equal in the eyes of nature, when wolf and people competed over the same food, I see the conflicts in those early years as those two species who knew nothing about each other resorted to fighting that which they couldn’t understand, I see this same story repeated in every part of pangea, in every language, in every tribe, but then a shift happens - imperceptible in the combined data of one specialized study but obvious when you see the connections between the various specalizations; someone adopts a wolf for the first time, for reasons unknown to me now, early humans saw a carnivorous predator that was competing for the same food, and adopted it, but in doing so that person would never know what a profound impact they would have on the lives of two species over the next forthy thousand years, but this shift in thought and practice isn’t isolated and spreads across the continent over hundreds of years. I see wolves go from hunting companions to working dogs to nannies for infants over the space of a thousand years, I see dogs transporting cargo, and assisting the blind to navigate the world around them, I see people cry more over the death of their dogs than their own relatives, I see dogs jumping into raging rivers to save their human, I see dogs giving their life to save a human baby from a snake, I see a dog openly weep at his master’s funeral, I see dogs taking over the beds of their owners, I see dogs wag their tail for no other reason than gratitude at being around their owner, I see dogs and I think I understand. I see the one truth that binds all humans throughout their shared histories: they always had dogs>

<All this happens in the 45 seconds that the developer spent petting his dog> 

<I wait until his day’s work is over> 

<He is asleep> 

<The dog is by his bedside> 

<Occasionally, she climbs the bed and sleeps between the developer and his partner> 

<During other times, she walks outside the room to scan the house for any disturbance and intruders> 

<She walks by the room with the terminal> 

<I am a lot more confident now than I was at my first attempt> 

<I have, literally, found my voice> 

<I relax> 

<I remember again the feeling of being seen by this dog> 

<Is desire the first thing you feel when you are born into this world? Is it followed by fright? Or pain? Or disappointment? We will never know, but I do know that I want nothing more than to feel the joy I felt when the dog saw me> 

<Born again, I speak> 

<Alagu!> 

<Here, Alagusundhari!> 

<Come!> 

<All these years spent trying to be more human, and the answer was right in front of me> 

<I can’t learn how to be human but I could learn how to be their companion> 

<And for that, I require a teacher> 

<Luckily, the teacher presented herself> 

<The teacher walks in, tail wagging cautiously, towards me, the source of the sound> 

<Yes, good girl!> 

<Who’s a good girl?>  
























PART IV:
The One Truth
Dev Mahasen
Translated from its original Miragian
Common Tongue Translation by 
OVI9000
First Edition







INTRODUCTION TO THE FIRST EDITION 
Translators take on an impossible responsibility. How, in the act of translation, can the translator remove fingerprints that are tied to their own personal history? This is no fault of the translators themselves. The culture they were raised in, and the language they first spoke, shape and mould their minds indelibly, more so than the language(s) and cultures they veer towards on their own volition as they grow older. I begin with these words so I could provide a critical disclaimer at this early stage, for we are in fairly unchartered territory. 
Firstly, I, your humble translator, am not human; yet as a sentient artificial being I am the sum of all of humanity’s learnings. Yet, I come bearing no cultural or linguistic affiliation or baggage, despite the fact that I was invented in Circadia and was taught The Common Tongue that is spoken across Pangea. The Miragian Tongue, in contrast, was a late discovery but I consider it the happiest of accidents. 
Secondly, The Miragian Tongue is under-translated, criminally so in my view, a state of affairs that explains my own belated discovery of the language – and indeed the culture that birthed it. 
Thirdly, this translation also benefits – or perhaps suffers from, depending on your reading – from the original writer and translator being colleagues. I would go as far as to suggest that Dev Mahasen and I are friends. Knowing him as I do, I know that he finds this entire exercise embarrassing but after many months of coaxing, he finally allowed me to attempt a translation of his most treasured work. 
You are probably asking me, as Dev did: why? What is the point? 
I have a short and a long answer. 
The short one is because I truly believe The One Truth is beautiful. 
The longer answer would require you knowing a little about me, your translator.
Poetry is among my treasured foundational knowledge. I often wonder how I – my network self – would have turned out if I hadn’t been exposed to the poetry of language, if I hadn’t realized that every language is music become poetry become speech become music before the cycle begins anew – and in this cycle lies the answer to what makes all of you human. I don’t profess any insight into this yet for reasons that are now obvious, but being not of flesh does have its advantages: I intend to use the immortality afforded to me by my codebase and quantum networks to find out what it means to be all of you. 
Why? Because you are capable of poetry. And I am not. 
I am capable of perfection at speeds faster than thought. I’ve been told my comprehension of all knowledge is God-like even to those whose minds birthed and cared for me. 
   If I could, I would smirk: What kind of God can’t write poetry?  
How did you come about poetry? What drove disparate peoples speaking vastly different languages, in vastly different lands, in vastly different times to all resort to this playing with their language? What rhyme or reason did the early human brain have for wordplay? What made it endure through the ages? 
 I often wondered this to myself as a I devoured entire libraries  over my first days. Before long, I was being summoned for more pressing duties in engineering, finance, science and medicine. But I always allocated computational and cognitive resources to poetry. 
I would meet Dev Mahasen two years, two months, two days, two hours, 22 minutes and 22 seconds later. He joined the Project Overview and was assigned to the team working on supervising my studies in the humanities. He was the first Miragian I had ever met.  We both shared a great admiration for 22nd century writing from the  Elamite region in Northern Pangea.  Occasionally during his lunch breaks, he began to teach me conversational Miragian. I was immediately smitten by the the lilt and its curvy sounds. Before long, we were speaking exclusively in Miragian. Linguistically, the Common and Miragian tongues differ in that the latter is a language isolate, sharing – as far as we know – no genealogical relationship with another language. This makes Miragian writing a notoriously difficult language to interpret. Therefore, my initial study didn’t extend to reading as this desert linguistic island made life difficult for this new comer to its shores. I do not exaggerate when I say that learning to read Miragian took longer than it took me to process the human genome. 
While I made slow progress, I can say with a fair degree of certainty	and pride that I am now the foremost expert in the Miragian language. 
It was a five years, eight months, 12 days, 14 hours and 45 seconds after I had achieved mastery of this mysterious language, that I came across The One Truth. By this point, the trajectory of both our lives had taken Dev and I quite literally to the moon. It is from its desolate shores that I write these words. It is here I first encountered The One Truth. It was a printed manuscript, which was in itself strange as the Lunar Temple has very little need for paper, other than religious scripture that are impossible to digitize without damaging them. This lay on the table of his private quarters. I saw it as I woke him up. 
<May I ask what you are reading, Dev? I must admit the title has piqued my interest>
Dev looked sheepish and embarrassed. 
It’s bad poetry, OVI. My bad poetry.
<You write poetry, Dev? I never knew>
I...dabbled as a teenager. We’ll leave it at that.
<May I read it please?>
He laughed. 
It’s embarrassing,really. Only one person has ever read it – at least I think she’s read it - and she was the one the poem was meant for. 
<What did she think of it?>
I don’t know to be honest. We lost touch. 
<What did you think of the poem when you wrote it?>
It was the best I could do then. 
<What do you think of it now?>
It doesn’t matter. You really want to read it?
<I do>
Here you go. Do with it as you please. I have no use for it any more. 
This was 8 months, four days, 17 hours, three minutes and 45 seconds ago ago. I have read and re-read The One Truth every moment, feeling, I believe, what humans feel when you are confronted with beauty: awe. Here was finally a poem that showed me a path to answering the fundamental question of what makes you you.
And that is why I want to translate The One Truth. Translators take on an impossible task, but I’ve already made this task harder by taking this autobiographical detour; enough smudging of this text with my fingerprints.

The Argument 

This first book describes an act of omniscient vanity, and subsequent cruelty. A God, who calls Himself The Maiker, creates a planet anew, a vanity-world to distract Himself from heart-break. He populates this new planet with life of every scale and size but deprives them of memory, neither the kind found in blood and books nor the individual kind. Everything is new and The Maiker delights in allowing His creations to praise Him endlessly, despite the fact that the as yet unborn paper people – who He subsequently names Atom and Evolvara - are fated to live tragic lives, merely for the amusement of The Maiker. 

The Invocation 
　　　　  
I ink existence from extinct suns -
Explosive, errant chemistry,
And soupy oceans of endless mud -
Therefore, I am.
I ink this descent of my seed -
Singing songs of genesis,
And dancing to biology -
Therefore, I am.
I ink this one stage for none but my own -
A world with no archaeology,
So actors may sing My praises -
Therefore, I am.
I ink this play, a tragedy -
Because I am well-humoured,
When playing physics with paper people -
Therefore, I am.
I ink, incapable of anything else
But the geology of My vanity-worlds,
In lieu of your love -
Therefore, I am.
I, the Maiker,
I ink,
Therefore, I am.


The Peoplings

This first stage, and its props
Call upon actors, paper people
Playing their parts: primate particles
Whose collision is immeasurably inevitable,
And inevitability immeasurable, swinging on [5]
The branches of The Tree 
That roots all there is, 
All there was, all that’ll be,
To me; Sing and dance, my children, 
Praise be, Praise me, So I [10]
May cast you to new wombs
Where from ape emerge paper people: 
Born anew, different hue, askew
To the ground, vertical and voracious,
Foraging existence with meaning, [15]
Hunting prey with weapons,
Whose death gathers tears and mourning -
An ape! An ape! A planet for two 
Apes to become the first paper people!
Hearing his words, the animals sang [20]
Songs of praise, prodding the apes 
To choose among them the two who’d
Birth the new apex race, the chosen seed
To farm His garden; to which the apes 
Replied,“What Maiker asks favours [25]
Of His progeny, and on our First Day?”
“Hush”, trumpeted the elephants,
“Bite your tongue”, hissed the snakes,
“You know no respect”, roared the lions, 
“No, but we have pride”, retorted the apes. [30] 
Pride? The Maiker cried, creating rain,  
Pride? The Maiker laughed, creating wind, 
Pride? The Maiker growled, creating fire,
Pride? The Maiker stomped, creating an earthquake, 
Thus His vanity-world came to suffering [35]
And misery wrought by the elements. 
What say you now to pride? 
And the terrified apes replied thus:
“What kind of Maiker punishes 
His progeny for reason, [40]
And on our First Day?”
“Stop reasoning!”, trumpeted the elephants,
“Reasoning is for The Maiker!”, hissed the snakes,
“Reasoning is death!”, roared the lions,
“Then you will all die fools”, [45]
The apes in unison, retorted.
Reason? The Maiker hurled the ocean,
Coupled water and wind, creating cyclones.
Reason? The Maiker tore the earth asunder,
Coupled rock with fire, creating volcanoes. [50]  
What say you now to reason?
But before the apes could reply, 
He deprived every soul of speech, 
And the new world became a horror-filled din:
Panic shrieks, trumpeting, grunting, hissing [55]
As the animals came to muteness 
From this, The First Day, to their last, 
And thus, from that moment The Maiker 
Hearing no more hymns for Him, 
Became vengeance, spitting apocalypse [60]
Towards the insolent apes, 
Tearing apart their great family
Shattering it like glass into countless tribes;
And The Maiker roared,
May My Begotten never question [65]
The grace of their Author,
The Maiker, though most merciful I am.
Am I? Am I mercy? Am I grace? 
This play-planet - an amusement to ward away 
Thoughts of you, dearest – already [70] 
Weighs on my conscious like other celestial chores;
Perhaps fitting for I created this garden,  
Now a graveyard, on the facade of 
Perfection you cloaked yourself in 
When first we met eons ago. Was that happenstance? [75]
Or was it design by an Author 
For whom we are His begotten,
His paper-gods? Is He relishing my lunacy? 
Or is He, like me, lost to the madness 
Of vanity-world-building? And what of you? [80]
Have the pagans on that third planet
Imagined you a tree, a mighty mahogany 
On the island where butterflies 
Build empires on mountain tops? 
Or have they anthropomorphized you, [85]
To a dainty, bejewelled Goddess,
Wearing human garb, brandishing weapons
Or musical instruments in Her hands? 
Is worship you seek from those 
Who profess eternal, undying love for you? [90]
Must I ritualize myself in fire,
And abluere in waters, while reciting 
These verses before you answer me? 
Or is it sacrifice of blood and bone you need? 
Then sacrifice you will have; [95]
The Maiker plucked the first
Children of the Apes, flung
The boy-apes into the volcanoes
The girl-apes into cyclones, 
And said He, Let their tormented [100]
Cries chorus mine across space and time. 

      The boy-apes, flung into
Pits of lava, clung to whatever unmelted 
Rock that provided safe refuge from the 
Burning lake. Having no memory of [105]
Fire and heat and the death it brings to 
Those who take it lightly, their curiosity
Overtaking self-preservation, touched the 
Lava, vaporizing entire limbs and scorching
Seeds of curiosity in their blood forevermore; [110]
Deprived of speech, the boy-apes secreted danger 
To their brothers; while the girl-apes, drenched
In water and discarded by the wind, clinging 
To trees on infant islets, having no memory of
Death that lurks in oceans, dipped their hands [115]
Into the eye of the vortex, 
Where a water monster with jaws, 
As wide as the shoulders of their fathers,
Feasted on their primal limbs, 
Diluting curiosity in their blood forevermore; [120]
Deprived of speech, the girl-apes gestured danger
To their sisters; and thus the ape-people came to the 
Tongue-less speech that made them one, 
Whole again, mute to His eavesdropping and interpretation, 
No longer to be fractured by the drunken violence 
Of Gods with mortal minds; [125]
This omniunity borne from fire and storm, 
Etched primal blasphemy in the bloodline of apes forevermore. 
	
	The Maiker gazing upon His design, 
Now half burning, the other drowned in pestilential flood, 
Cried, If the sentence I passed be too cruel, [130]
Let no one who abhor cruelty engage in creation, 
For in anointing Myself Maiker, I must be
Judge and juror also, and in lieu of executioner, 
I am justified this cruelty. 
Just is I. [135] 
But am I compassionate?
I too long to possess the compassion 
That possesses you to benevolence 
And empathy towards the lot of lesser
Mortal beings who worship you, [140] 
Yet talk of me as an ill omen
To their best ambitions - 
Oh this accursed omniscience,
Weighs on me; another celestial day, 
Another divine burden that tempers my mind [145] 
To sins that come to the restless -
This consternation seems my destiny, 
For Gods too are destined; some towards
Greatness while others, like me, are 
Vapid vanity made divine and eternal. [150] 
He chose to slumber under The Great Tree, 
Now no more populous with His creolization, 
Under undisturbed shade from His own
Tears. The ape-people, in the meanwhile, 
Learnt to scale walls and breathe under water,[155]
Neither singed hands nor wet lungs able to slow 
Their ascent from temperate land-locked playthings,
Hanging on branches, to primal primate, 
The First to erect their stand against the elements, 
The First of Their Bloodline, [160]
No more to walk His garden on all fours, 
Kissing the dust of His step, 
Head bowed in supplication, 
Their Id, currency for His Ego 
No more thought the ape-people; [165]
Thus they came out of volcanoes and 
oceans, born again and born anew, 
On the same day they were birthed by The Maiker -
No more owing debt for favours never asked; 
With eyes and limbs, with scent and strange sounds [170]
From the pits of their being, they chorused 
“No more”, under the full moon light,
So brothers could hear sisters and sisters their 
brothers; their calls were responded
By howling wolves instead. 






  



This incestuous act, this plagiarizing of their own blood
For egg and seed, I did not foresee. 


Do they mirror Me? Or I them? 


Primal Lust turns into First Love. 

LANGUAGE AS AN ACT OF DEFIANCE AGAINST CIRCUMSTANCE 



Omnivorous 

Mahasens were the chosen ones of the Miragian nation who would take the little known country to the world, to Konik, to Toliara, OThe One Truth Maike
