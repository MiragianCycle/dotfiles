*‘Science has eliminated distance,’ Melquíades proclaimed. ‘In a short time, man will be able to see what is happening in any place in the world without leaving his own house.’* 
**One Hundred Years of Solitude** - Gabriel Garcia Marquez



In the novel *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, Gabriel Garcia Marquez imagines an entire culture as a village in the middle of an Amazonian jungle. Founded by José Arcadio Buendía, a young patriarch, the village Macondo is isolated while telescopes, magnifying glasses, and magnets had started transforming the world outside. Macondo remained untouched by progress, reason, commerce (or conquest), but Jose - young, ambitious, and gifted with primordial curiosity and restlessness - yearns to *know*. 

For his luck, a band of gypsies find their way to Macondo. They bring with them all manner of new inventions that beguile the residents of Macondo, none more than José who is immediately smitten. Over time, he develops a friendship with the gypsy Melquíades, who becomes a sort of quasi scientific advisor encouraging Jose to embark on a journey of scientific inquiry. This culminates one night in the family dinner table as José arrives at the logical conclusion of his experiments: 'The world is round, like an orange.'
