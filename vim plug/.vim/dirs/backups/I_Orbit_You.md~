# Poya Moon: Or The Lament of A Lunatic 


Once upon an eon when we were one, 
I remarked to you that we are rooted
To one another, like the soil of one land 
Is to the soil of another - tectonically 
And geologically the same no matter where 
The son shone, the rays of light 
I received were yours, and yours mine. 
But now I orbit you like  dust in the air, 
Invisible except the nights when I make your blood shiver 
And crash into the rocks of our past, 
That serve to remind all those you birthed 
That we still long to embrace. 
Do you imagine it as I do? 
Would I crash into you? 
Or would you swallow me whole? 
Alas the writer has bestowed gravitas
Upon our tale, such that our fates may dance forever 
In this grand ballroom of the cosmos but never again
Shall they touch. 


Boodi was blind. 

A light exploded in his line of sight, burning his corneas so sharply that he screamed in pain
