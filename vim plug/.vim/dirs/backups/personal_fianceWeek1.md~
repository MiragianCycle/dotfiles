        - Education and training are expensive. Fortunately, there are number of different programs that can help you meet your education and training costs. In this module, we provide information on the major types of programs available. We provide most information about programs that let you save taxes when you save for education before you or your younger generations actually go to college or some other after high school training program. Such programs include the Coverdell Program, a wide variety of 529 plans and even your retirement savings programs such as a Roth IRA.

Finally, we provide materials considering the pros and cons of student loans.
    - *Topic 3* — Using Your Human Capital to Make a Living: Working for Someone Else or For Yourself?
        - The rise of the Gig Economy and the increasing flux in jobs means that most of us will at some points in our lives receive all our income from a job, combine a job with self employment and have periods where our entire income comes from self employment. This section of the course shows you how both to make the most of a job and how to make the most of self employment. For example, we show how to read and understand a job offer by carefully considering the salary, benefits and restrictions that will be placed on you by your employer. We show how to develop a business plan and how to use the tax system to pay for health insurance and save for retirement when you are self employed. To make work choices realistic, we show how Rajiv evaluates his job offers and how Alexa manages her business, selects a health plan and saves for retirement.
