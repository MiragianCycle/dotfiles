## WEEK /MODULE [^1] 

- This course isn't *social media marketing* or *digital marketing*, but rather marketing through social media
- We will learn how to think of marketing for the connected world - this goes beyond the traditional 4Ps of marketing first proposed by Kotler 


#### WEB 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 





## WEEK /MODULE [^2] 


- Andreas Kaplan and Michael Highland from the ESCP business school in Paris, have defined social media as 'as a  group of internet applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of the web 2.0 and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content'
- So far in this module we have discussed social media channels, and their respective cultures 


## WEEK /MODULE [^3]

- Thus far we have learnt about the first quadrant of the social media matrix - i.e. Communication; now we will focus our attention on the Sharing quadrant of the social media matrix. 
- The focus here is creating content that is atttributable to a brand, and has value to their stakeholders (note, not just customers)
- Word of mouth is the phenomenon through which messages go through societies - in online communities this is called electronic word of mouth. 
- Management research has identified two factors that drive word of mouth: these are 
    - Self involvement- this is a mark of self-identification 
    - Other involvement - this is an innate need to be part of tribes that have driven human cultures


![image-20210519171918922](image-20210519171918922.png)
- The above image encapsulates the basic differences between the transmission and recommendation ways that word of mouth goes out



- Marketing has changed in the last few decades especially after the integration with social media. Traditionally, the marketing mix was centered around the product, but increasingly this is no longer enough to cut through the noise. 
- Marketing is now focused on artificial word of mouth - consider the tech industry, and how 'leaks' are now part of the communication strategy though it is doubtful any of the companies themselves would admit as much 
- A increasingly mature view of 'viral marketing' is that it is increasingly unsustainable, and that instead the focus of marketing content should be '*spreadability*'
- Spreadability differs to virality in that it is focused on the following principles:
        - Content adapts to the platform, not the other way around 
        - Content is spread through personal social media accounts, not through corporate accounts 
        - Consumers appropriate content, and use it for their own purpose 

- *WHAT MAKES CONTENT SPREADABLE?*
        - Vanity 
        - Identity 
        - Community 
        - Meaning 
- Large social media phenomenon such as the Gnangam Style, the Ice Bucket Challenge all satisfy the basic criteria of spreadable content 
- **In these cases, people felt they had a stake in the content**
- Content must be open to multiple interpretations in order to spread
- The loss of the producer's control over meaning is a precondition for spreadability and circulation 
- For content to spread, make sure they satisfy the following conditions:
        - BELONGING 
        - SOCIAL COMPARISON 
        - SOCIAL STAKING 
        - SENSE MAKING

### Real-time marketing  

- We talked mostly about Oreos' and other *reactive marketing* on social media 
- The concept of *war rooms* is also important to keep in mind 
- It is important to recognize that word of mouth as *transmission* and *recommendation* are two distinct sides of the same phenomenon 
- Mechanisms and objectives differ for *transmission* and *recommendation* type word of mouth 
    - *Word of mouth as transmission* has situational involvement 
    - In this case, consumers aren't interested in talking *about* you but *through* you 
    - When talking through you they are interested in talking about themselves or with others* you 
    - When talking through you they are interested in talking about themselves or with others
- In making spreadable content, remember that the *brand is secondary*; what is important is to **promoting bonding, social comparing, social staking, and sense-making* 


### The Power of Rating and Reviews  

- These are powerful because they represent a subsection of consumers who are more experts 
- These kind of customers carry a certain clout 
- Around 90% of customers trust online reviews trust more than recommendations 
- 60% of consumers are likely to buy when they see reviews that have a collection of good and bad reviews 
- Reviews and rating on e-commerce sites (Amazon) and specific niche sites (TripAdvisor, PCMagazine) are particularly hefty when talking about products from specific markets 


### The Power of Reviews and Ratings 

- Why do we read reviews and ratings? 
- One reason consumer read reviews with social proof 
- Purchases come with a certain risks - reviews and ratings prepare them for the best and worst aspects of a product 
- Reviews that are based on filtered criteria - in the case of PCs, this can be done with different configuration options 
- Therefore it is important to assess similarity to reviews 

### The Influence of Influencers 

- Personal Influence, a book by the two management researchers, first posited that consumers don't make informed purchasing decisions through mass media but through the opinions of consumers like them 
- There are three kinds of influencers: Mavens, Connectors and Salesmen
    - *Mavens* is a yiddish word that means *one who accumulated knowledge*. 
    - Mavens have a lot of marketplace knowledge 
    - Mavens love helping others make an informed purchasing decision 
    - Another type of consumer are called *Connectors* 
    - Connectors play an important role is the spreading of information 

## WEEK /MODULE [^4]

-  Best Practices example: Social Media Customer Service at Dell 
-  Dell offered customer service and reviews and ratings 
-  Leveraged bloggers and influencers BEFORE social media during the blog era
-  Around 2010, five years of *Dell Hell*, Dell's brand had become a better customer service brand 
-  Dell created a social media and community team around 2011 
-  The Social Media and Community became the overlapping and centralized department dedicated to social media for all Dell's internal department 
-  This made the communications a lot more cohesive, proactive, and better integrated with their customers and the conversations the customers were having on social media 
- Dell also began to source content from many contributors 
- They created a Social Media University that became an employee training centre to became part of the conversation with Dell's customers 
- These employees became Dell ambassadors online after they received the certification from Dell's Social Media University 
- Currently around 17,000 employees are certified to represent Dell as Ambassadors on Social Media 
- Employees who have the highest engagement receive personal career enhancement



**USING SOCIAL MEDIA FOR INTELLIGENCE**

- Social media is a wonderful tool for *proactive* and *reactive* customer care 
- Because of the vast amounts of data that is generated, this data can then be fed into the marketing pipeline, from a strategic, operational and tactical standpoint 
- Social media as a *proactive* tool also works as a means to collaborate with the community (or a brand's superfans) on new products, and indeed for market research and focus groups 
- Now let us consider using social media as an intelligence gathering mechanism
- **Nethnography** is the ethnographic study of online communities




**BUILDING COMMUNITY THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA**

- In this section we will focus to closing the customer journey loop with communities 
- Think of the Customer Journey funnel - traditionally, the funnel ends with purchase; in the case of e-commerce, this funnel can become a loop where, in the post-purchase phase, a customer joins a community dedicated to that brand or product 
- Such communities facilitate repurchasing and customer loyalty 
- Communities can be brand-owned (such as Lego Land) or customers owned 
- The anthropological view of community used to exist around geography, shared language, culture 
- In today's age, community transcends geography, language and culture 
- These are ephermal 
- Communities have rituals (such as Comic Con)
- Communities are also capable of **moral responsibility** - map this to the open source community 
- There are 5Ps to building communities. These are 
    - PURPOSE 
    - PLATFORM 
    - PEOPLE 
    - PARTICIPATION 
    - PROFITS 
- Homework. Read **GETTING BRAND COMMUNITIES RIGHT** [^5]








[^5]: ### GETTING BRAND COMMUNITIES RIGHT

- This article is about myths built around online communities 
    - **MYTH 1** *A brand community is a marketing strategy* **REALITY** ***A brand community is a business strategy***
    - **MYTH 2** *A brand community exists to serve the business*  **REALITY** ***A brand community exists to serve the people in it*** 
    - **MYTH 3** *Build the brand, and the community will follow*  **REALITY** ***Engineer the community, and the brand will be strong*** 
    - **MYTH 4** *Brand communities should be love-fests for faithful brand advocates* **REALITY** ***Smart companies embrace the conflicts the make communities thrive***
    - **MYTH 5** *Opinion leaders build strong communities* **REALITY** ***Communities are strongest when everyone plays a role*** 
    - **MYTH 6** *Online social networks are the key to a communication strategy*  **REALITY** ***Online networks are just one toll, not a community strategy***
    - **MYTH 7** *Successful brand communities are tightly managed and controlled* **REALITY** ***Of and by the people, communities defy managerial control***
- Brand communities imply that there is a certain ownership of the platform i.e. they aren't built on top of social networks such as FB, Twitter, etc., instead they are built on company infrastructure.
- This entails having to bear certain costs: **FINANCIAL HUMAN_RESOURCES PATIENCE** are all important in building a community of your own
- If this cost is prohibitive, then companies can join existing communities that are built around the product/brand such as Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc.,

### COMMUNITY MEMBER TOPOLOGY

![image-20210528003211693](image-20210528003211693.png)

- A successful community manages to give its members, no matter where they fall into the above topological map, a progression where even *tourists* can become *devotees* or *insiders*
- Another successful challenge is to convert lurkers into participants 


### INCITING AND REWARDING CONTRIBUTORS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

- Even the HEC member forum displays all four quadrants of the topology
- ==Threadless== is a great example of a community-first business as it started out as a customer-first forum 
- Regardless Threadless has had issues as it grew because the balance between the community's user types began to skew heavily towards the tourists
- This resulted in the community's priorities also being skewed 
- The case of Threadless offers a lesson on the challenges that community managers face as their online memberships grow: ==How do you encourage contributors and contributions when contributions cannot be forced and non-contribution cannot be penalized. 
- This is what in digital community academia referred to as the ==Freeloader Problem== [Personally, I can speak for this as I am a lurker/tourist in most tech forums]
- One way community managers increase engagement in the form of contributions is to display badges or achievement gains (in gaming speak) 
- Badges work because they give direction - look at Habitica 
- Badges also offer social recognition - think about the anonymous Wikipedia contributor 
-

## MONITORING AND METRICS: HOW TO MEASURE SOCIAL MEDIA ROI 

- We've learnt that social media is part of the overall pipeline of marketing activities 
- But social media too carries over some of the challenges in measuring social media particularly in terms of measuring ROI. These include: 
    - Difficulty to tie social media results to business outcomes 
    - Lack of expertise, resources and tools 
    - Inconsistent analytical reports, approaches, making it difficult to reconcile data 
- Too much data, too much unreliable data 
- What are the basics of measuring and monitoring? Avinash Kaushik recommends a 90-10 ratio i.e. 90% on hiring people and 10% on the tools. 
- His rational is that tools can generate all the reports in the world but without skilled personnel to interpret it, and offer insight that comes from the data, is more valuable
- A sensible approach is to focus on a few metrics instead of trying to hit all of them at the same time. 
- This leads to the question of how we can determine what is a significant metric for the business that the brand is in? 
- Who is going to use the data? Engagement metrics is most salient 
- Marketing managers would know where social media is in their customer's journey; marketing managers would also want to see more robust data, linking social media to the purchasing decisions of their customers
- Integration of all these is difficult, which is why dedicated data analysis critical

#### ASSIGNMENT 

I am Sri Lankan, with digital marketing experience across the Asian Pacific markets. It is for that reason I am going to choose the South Asian region with a focus on the Indian market. 

My reasoning for India is as follows:

+ India is one of the fastest growing markets in the world. IMF data shows that it has risen to the position of the **fifth largest economy in the world** as of 2020 [^1] when ranked by nominal GDP - outranking the UK and France. 
+ India is home to the world's largest middle class in the world [^2], who are extremely brand concious. The following are also pertinent in this regard:
    + India's middle class was estimated to be around 600 million as at 2012 
    + Households with high disposable income have risen twenty-fold since 1990 
    + Households' savings have tripled between 2005 - 2012 
+ India's youth are extremely brand concious [^3][^4]
+ 15% of the 1.3 billion population are aged between 15-24, while the median age is 29.8 years as of 2020

I believe the above factors would make India a highly attractive market for Le Slip Français. 


#### ACTION PLAN 1: The Threads that Connect Us 
- **WHY** Entering the Indian market by paying tribute to its thriving, ageless and diverse costumes
- **WHO** Middle-class youth. These are students and young professionals from middle to upper middle class homes.
- **WHAT** No part of India has the same clothing and textile preference because India is a melting pot of countless cultures that fall under the modern nation state of India. Southern Indian clothes and textile traditions are different to their fellow Indians in the North, East and West. Within these regions, lie States that have their own languages, cultures and traditions. One of the ways these traditions are displayed is through their clothing  - thus each state would have costumes it considers native to its people and population. This affords a wonderful opportunity for Le Slip Francais to enter each of these sub-markets with a personalized hello, grounding the hello message in the respective state's colours and textiles. 
- **VALUE TO CUSTOMER** Every large multi-national that has entered the Indian market in the last decade - and this list includes Amazon, Google, among other large corporate titans - have done so by embracing the sheer diversity of what being Indian means. Thus, entering the state of Tamil Nadu would use silk from the region of *Kanchipuram* (legendary for its exotic silk trade), and bright colours such as red and orange, using the Tamil language. Similarly, entering the state of Maharashtra would require the use of cotton, more muted oranges, and the language being Marati. 
- **VALUE TO Le Slip Francais**  Le Slip Francais is a youthful, irreverent brand. India is the world's largest youth market. This idea is a variant of their Le Slip Francais's French-centric campaign where they created designs to represent each state. Here too, we will ask the youth of each state to submit design based on the respective Indian culture that they hail from. 
- **MEASURING SUCCESS** Le Slip Francais will measure itself against other large fashion retailers who are already in the market. We will aim to ensure that most of the engagement happens on the company website - i.e. design submission. We will do this through a strategic focus on building the community with focus on ensuring that there is a good balance between tourists, devotees, insiders, and minglers. Month on Month (MoM) our criteria will focus on migrating 10% of the social fan-base (spread across Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, and Snapchat) to become registered users on the site. 


#### ACTION PLAN 2: The Influence of Indian Influencers 
- **WHY** India's population has two great loves: cinema and the sport of cricket. The best known film and cricket stars have been influencers for decades before the internet or social media. The new generation of Indian influencers, thus, come into a culture where it is expected for celebrities to endorse products and services. Over the years, stars such as Sachin Tendulkar and MS Dhoni have become cultural icons as a result of their on-field/on-screen achievements, and their omnipresence on local advertisements. 

    The new generation's poster child is Virat Kolhi, India's national cricket captain. He also happens to be among the Top 10 highest earning athletes in the world, sharing the list with luminaries such as Christiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, LeBron James and Roger Federer. Unlike the previous generation of Indian influencers, though, Virat Kohli's presence on social media is also vast. Across Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, his lifestyle and product endorsements (over a thousand) punctuate selfies and peaks into his life, married to Bollywood's most bankable leading lady. 

    His appeal therefore among Le Francais' target market is vast, but his position among older Indians too is also high. It could be argued that in a nation that is as diverse as India, it'd need an influencer who cuts across all the different Indian regions, languages and cultures. That Indian would be Virat Kohli. 
- **WHO** Once again, our focus here is youth. But unlike the first plan, where emphasis was on design and tradition and personalization, the emphasis here is lifestyle. And whose lifestyle among Indian youth is the most envied and marketable? Virat Kohli. 
- **WHAT** The Big Idea here is centered around the celebrity of India's most iconic star. 
- **VALUE TO CUSTOMER** As alluded to above, the combination of brand conciousness among Indians, the vast influence its celebrities have on Indian purchasing decisions, results in *perceived value* 
- **VALUE TO Le Slip Francais** entering a huge, highly fragmented market like India will always come with it many challenges. One of the many ways other MNCs have tried to mitigate this is by using Indian influencers (I shall refer to them as Pan-Indian in their influence) to spread the message. This creates buzz and word of mouth faster and more widely than a campaign that doesn't center around a celebrity. Such a route offers Le Slip Francais capturing mind-space among its target customers across India, quickly. While this route will feature a large portion of the marketing budget going towards the celebrity in question, it results in more cost-friendly marketing in the medium and long run due to the after effects of the first celebrity-centered campaign. 
- **MEASURING SUCCESS**  Our measurement here would be engagement on social, mentions - positive vs negative sentiment analysis, and sales on the site.
