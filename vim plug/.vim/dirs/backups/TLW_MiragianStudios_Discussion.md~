**GOALS**

*A Last Word and Miragian Studios collaboration, this project is a prototype for a NFT-based art project. The goal is to create a series of NFT-BASED art based on an existing universe. The team at The Last Word have already set up the online assets; Miragian Studios will provide the open universe upon which the game will be based*

<## Rules of the Miragian universe 

- This planet will go through the karmic cycle of death and rebirth - this happens on a planet wide scale, and it completely random. This means that the story can take place in any part of the planet, but since I've started with Mirage, hence it is called Miragian Studios. 

- There is one super contient - this continent is called *Pangea* and the planet is called *Gaia* 

- Immaculate conception is a real phenomenon - about 0.001% of the population of Mirage is officially recognized as *Immaculate* 

- *Immortality* exists. To be precise, immortality in human terms, and not cosmic.>`

*The above is a character psychological tool. It allows you to answer questions that writers have to answer in the process of sketching or creating characters. When you visualize a characters arc with numbers, under the two scales of INTERNAL and EXTERNAL you can almost visualize the events that tipped this chracter to go from 2-4 in the example above. 

You can take real life figures and ask yourself how thier lives can be reprepresented with the following scale. For example, Maithiripala Sirisena. You can represent the arc of Maithiripala journey as follows:* 

INTERNAL: 4 | 5-4-2 | 1
EXTERNAL: 3 | 4-5-3 | 1`

# PLOT 

A generational ship passing the last planet of our solar system experiences social upheaval that leads to a mutiny in the ship. Who will remain in charge?

## CONFLICTS 

**Good: Dumend and Hindama**
**Bad: Kacj**

Father v Son: Old school v New school: Old way of thinking v the new

## SETTING 

The ship is passing Pluto, the former planet. As they pass, a mysterious force begins to exert its power on the passengers of the generational ship. This force acts even on the large population who are frozen in cryogenic sleep - some of these people wake from their hibernation chambers extremely hysterical or in some cases violent, including the tendency to bite and eat human flesh. The crew - consisting of the deck staff (navigators, weapon engineers), and maintenance staff - are shaken to their core. This results in the previously tight knit crew to fracture into factions, some behind their captain, others beind his first lieutenant, Kacj. Meanwhile, the captain's son is unhappy - he doesn't want the military life despite the fact that he is a good soldier, and has been known for his bravery. He is in love with <someone>, a fact that Kacj will use to drive a wedge between the captain and his son. The scientific investigations reveal that whatever the force is only acts on those who are asleep - until more is known the only defense against it is to not sleep, essentially insomnia.
