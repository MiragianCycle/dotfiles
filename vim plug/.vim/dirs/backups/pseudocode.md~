Wed 02 Jun 2021 01:37:09 PM +0530

*Assume you are creating a sports league of sorts. For a given number of teams (n) that have to play (y) number of games per season, find out how many total matches the league would host in total for a season*

### Variables 

1. n **number of teams**
2. y **number of matches per team**

**STEPS**

1. greet user 
2. Ask user how many teams
3. Ask user for number of matches / team
4. Calculate total number of matches for / team 
5. Calculate total number of matches to he hosted by league 


`printf('Hello')
printf('How many teams in your league?')
user.input = n
printf('How many games per team?') 
user.input = y
totalGamesPerTeam = n * y 
printf ('totalGamesPerTeam?')

Solutions:

1. **SIMPLE** (n/2)* totalGamesPerTeam - in this example, let's say *n* is 8 and *y* is 16 (i.e. each team has to play two games, home and away) then it would be (8/2)*16 which would be 4*16 = 64

2. Mathematical explanation from [here](https://qr.ae/pG2Gw3)

If there are 32 teams in a league and each team played every other team one time, how many games would there be?

Well, if there are 32 teams, then each team will have to participate in 31 games in order to play all of the games. 31 * 32 = 992, but THAT count is actually twice the number we want because each game involves 2 teams.

So, my final answer would be 496 games, Alex.

Edit: There’s an even more ‘elegant’ way to think of this that also gives the ‘right’ answer.

Let’s take all 32 teams and bring them all together. Now, let team 1 play all of the other teams. That would be 31 games. Team one now retires as they have played all their games.

Now, team 2 starts up and plays the remaining 30 teams for a total of 30 games. Team 2 now retires as they have played all their games.

Now, team 3 starts up and plays the remaining 29 teams for a total of 29 games. Team 3 now retires as they have played all their games.

We just keep this process up until we have all of the games played and each level will play one less game than the one before it until we get down to the last 2 teams and they play 1 game and BOTH of them retire because they have played all their games and there’s nobody left to play.

Mathematically, this looks like:

1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + . . . . . . + 31

The formula for a summation of 1 to n (step 1) is n(n + 1)/2

since n is 31, then (n + 1)/2 must be 16, so we have 31 * 16,If there are 32 teams in a league and each team played every other team one time, how many games would there be?
