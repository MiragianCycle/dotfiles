Misentropy 

While the universe heads to chaos
we head the other way, for no one knows 
this two-way street that leads to 
eternal spring where the flowers 
we pluck become the seeds we sow. 

While the universe turns to dust
we battle with brooms, for no one knows 
time can lead us back to 
the once clock-less space when
dust storms were the harbingers of light.

While the yolk of the universe spills over,
we gather in the kitchen, for no one knows 
this earth can become egg again, pregnant 
like the hearth that warmed hearts of
the sinner and the sinned, the prophet and blasphemer.

No one knows but you do, 
you have always known, 
that broken mirrors still reflect light; 
and now I know, for I was a broken mirror
and now I have light, 
and that light will always be you.
