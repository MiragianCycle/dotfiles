| The brain           | The brain. Capable of so much, the most complex object in the world. Thoughts, problem-solving, speech, art, music all began their journeys in a brain much like yours. Since our focus is writing, the question that must be answered is WHAT IS A WRITING BRAIN? |
|                     | Neurologically speaking, the brain's plasticity requires repetition - in the form of practice, and simulation - to mould itself for an activity or the other. Think of your favourite musician - they have probably spent hours honing their skills, and their minds, for that activity. Writing is no different. |

###### **ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE VIDEO ESSAY*

<Favourite paragaraph from One Hundred Years of Solitude> 

I first read One Hundred Years of Solitude in 2010 as my father lay in terminal decline from cancer. Those who were around me at that time would see me immersed in the book - at the  beach, in a bus, on my bed, while travelling for work, the list was endless. A few weeks after I completed reading the book, he died. Since then, I've returned to Gabriel Garcia Marquez's greatest novel far too many times. Each time, I return refreshed. As a writer, I know my first book wouldn't have happened if I hadn't come across the novel. As the son of a father taken away far too soon - and with far too much pain - I know without 100 Years of Solitude,  I wouldn't have had the strength to deal with his loss. It is the only book I carry around in my bag; just knowing it is there within reach at a moment's notice is a source of immense comfort - if that sounds like a religious person's relationship with their respective scripture, well I suppose 100 Years of Solitude is the closest I have to scripture in my life. 

This video essay is a long time coming. Several times I've tried to put my thoughts down on what the novel means to; several times I've abandoned the exercise as the writing descends to ridiculous praise. I will try then to keep praise to a minimum, and focus instead on what makes this novel work, and why it resonates with so many people. 

<Insert plot summary here, keep it minimal> 

100YoS is a masterclass in pacing. No more is this apparent than in the opening paragraph where Colonel Buendia is on the verge of being executed. Marquez sets the scene, and then in one sentence - the first sentence no less - takes us from that moment, to Colonel Buendia's future, and his past, to that distant day when his father took him to discover ice. 

Everytime I read that sentence I marvel at its economy of effort in conveying a vast swathe of a person's life. Anecdotal evidence tell us that Marquez was driving his family to their vacation when the tone and opening sentence exploded in his brain. He is said to have turned the car around, gone into his room, and written non stop for 18 months. When he emerged from the room, One Hundred Years of Solitude was ready for the world. 

Marquez Mythology aside, the reason I want to focus on this first sentence is because this sentence taught me the importance of opening sentences. Your first sentence won't come to you in your first draft, but as the draft is coming together, you should pay attention to it more, refining it so that tonally, narratively, and stylistically it is pitch perfect for the story you are about to take the reader on. Marquez is a master of first sentences. Here are samples of great opening sentence by Marquez, curated personally by yours truly - obviously a subjective list so cut me some slack here.
