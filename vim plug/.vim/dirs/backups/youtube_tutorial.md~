***NOW GET TO THE POINT OF THE VIDEO***

[**VOICE OVER & SCREEN ONLY**]: 

In this first episode you will learn three writing drills or warmup exercises that I've found to be very helpful over the years. Together and with constant practice, these drills go a long way in ensuring that your writing brain is ready produce the kind of writing that moves you, the writer. 

Before you go into the first drills, let's talk about some housekeeping that is salient for this episode and any subsequent videos that will come up in this channel. 

If you want to just get the drills, I've included convenient timestamps in the description for relevant sections of the video. Feel free to jump around the video as you see fit. 

Right, housekeeping. Three things to note: 

1. All exercises carried out in these tutorials can be followed along on any text editor or Word Processor of your choice, and on any platform. Most of my tools are open sourced and free, but there is no requirement that you need to follow these tutorials on the same software. People's computing choices are deeply personal and subjective - therefore all exercises here can be theoretically performed on any text editor or Word processor of your choice, and yes that includes your mobile phone. 

2. However, all these drills are keyboard centric - i.e. they are built around the act of writing on keyboards, and not the act of writing using pen and paper. The simple reason for this: my handwriting has always been too inconsistent for me to rely on for actual writing - I don't think I've written anything seriously using pen and paper since the age of 16. This doesn't mean that writers who prefer pen and paper can't follow these drills; I would encourage you, however, to give some thought to the idea of [*writing for practice* versus *writing for performance*](include on-screen graphic of PRACTICE WRITING not equal to PERFORMANCE WRITING), and adapt these drills to your own routines however you see fit. 

3. In future episodes, these drills will get progressively harder, but I encourage you to do these three every day - the more practice you give your writing brain, the better it will be when the time come to write the stories that matter most to you. 

Now, you may ask: WHY?  

**[ONSCREEN GRAPHIC]** ***(WHY DRILLS?)***

Think about your favourite musician. [**BROLL**: Moonlight Sonata III MVMT,  opening bars] Imagine the hours of practice that goes into their craft and performance, the thousand of hours they would have spent honing their craft behind the curtains. 

This is the same for athletes as well [**BROLL**: Serena Williams at practice] - they too have to do a lot of unglamourous, unsexy work by themselves before they can display their skills in front of people. 

Artists are forever doodling. [**BROLL** Bob Ross]

Why then do writers not practice, and only go straight into performance? 

Granted 'performance' for writers doesn't mean in front of people like musicians and athletes. 

This lack of writing practice comes to haunt us when it matters most. We’ve all been there, right? On our keyboards, staring at our screens with our manuscripts stuck at the same line for hours, and, more often than not, we are all by ourselves. [**BROLL** From Adaptation where the ‘serious’ writer twin is going through deep crisis of confidence and writers’ block]

 WRITERS' BLOCK happens because we go into performance with no practice. 

Our writing brains, till then mostly under-utilized and rusty [**BROLL** Shakespeare in Love], has to suddenly give life to a plot, to characters, write dialogue, impose structure, change perspectives, jump around in time and space - that is hard work. So the next time you are at staring at a empty Word document, ask yourself if your writing brain has had enough exercise and practice. The answer is probably no. [**BROLL** Brian Cox in Adaptation]

These drills then are designed to exercise your writing brain so that over time -  not **overnight** but **over time** - your writing brain is ready for performance. 

Remember, **Practice** versus **Performance**. 

These drills are for practice, they are not performance. 

As any musician, athlete or artist would tell you, practice matters. 

Practice is the safe space in which we suck at the thing we want to be good at. 

Give yourself permission to suck. 

It’s okay. 

Writing is like the ending of The Shawshank Redemption. 

There is a lot of this [**BROLL** Tim Robbins wading through shit]

before there is this **[BROLL ** Tim Robbins enjoying freedom. 

But it certainly doesn’t have to be this. [**BROLL** Jack Nicholson’s wife in The Shining discovering his writer’s block]

Okay. Onwards. 

There are three drills, all of which are built around Stream of Conciousness-type writing. [**BROLL**  The Architect in The Matrix Revolutions] [*SOUND EFFECT:* *crickets*]

Ready? [**BROLL** Geoffrey Rush in Quills smiling manically]

**[ONSCREEN GRAPHIC]** ***(THE DRILLS)***

The first drill removes all constraints - grammar, plot, commonsense, logic, realism, even the subjective ideas that you may have for what constitutes good writing. We are doing this to remove fear of "bad writing" that all writers feel as they read their fresh-out-of-the-oven writing. The great advantage of this drill is that it doesn't matter if whatever you vomit out is good or bad - either way, the writing is deleted soon after. I would practice this to a timer - start with 5 mins, and then gradually extend it. 

Let me show you. 

I am going to set the timer to around a minute, in the interest of your sanity. 

**[ONSCREEN GRAPHIC]** ***(DRILL I)*** 

(1 minute, with keyboard sound and unintrusive BG music]. 

See that was utter nonsense, but it was also liberating nonsense. And that's the point. By doing this I've gone some way in clearing some of the garbage that is collected in my brain. 





<u>Let's keep moving to the second drill.</u> 

This one differs from the first in that it introduces one kind of constraint - what that constraint is I leave to you. Some examples of constraint include grammar and spelling, or it can be word count, or it could be form, or it could be tone, the point is that there is a world of constraints out there. Pick one today. Pick another tomorrow. But use this drill with a variety of constraints, and it will payback. 

Pro tip: choose a constraint that you identify as a weakness in your writing - using the drill to focus on getting better at this area of weakness in your writing. I don't consider myself to be a good writer of dialogue so I use this drill to work on that weakness. I am going to keep this to one minute once again for the sake of demonstration.  

**[ONSCREEN GRAPHIC]** ***(DRILL II)*** 

(1 minute with keyboard sound and timer, and unintrusive bgm)



<u>The third drill</u> is introducing multiple constraints - start with two, and then add more as you become comfortable. I am going to give myself two constraints: form i.e. it has to be dialogue-driven, and plot i.e. it has to have a beginning, middle and end. Now if you combine this drill with a timer, it naturally makes the drill a lot more intense. As such, I think it is important to set the timer to a sane level at the start - say 15 mins, and then gradually shave a minute off every week. By the time you are do Drill  III to timers set to single digits, you will find that it is such a rush. 

 I will speed this section up to be 2 minutes long instead of the full 15 mins. 

**[ONSCREEN GRAPHIC]** ***(DRILL III)***

(15 minutes timelapsed footage, no keyboard bg, and music)



Woot! That was intense. Whoever said sitting down to write is boring has no idea what they are on about. 

That was fun. It was liberating. 

And the best part: none of that nonsense has to go into your manuscripts. 

Essentially, these three drills serve to rid your brain of the unnecessasry minutae and innanites that we clog our brains with.

**[ONSCREEN GRAPHIC]** (CLOSING THOUGHTS)

Hey, if you’ve made it this far, great job. I hope you find these exercises useful. More importantly, I hope that you start incorporating these warmup drills everyday. It doesn’t have to be just before you write - do this exercise on your messaging app of choice, do this while you are messing around on social media, do this a couple of times a day even if you aren’t writing. The possibilities are endless. 

For best results, Drill 1 and 2, the timer has to be set at 5 minutes, and gradually increased a minute at a time every week. Drill 3, on the other hand, works best by *reducing* time. So start at 15 minutes and then shave a minute off every week. 

In summary, writing is bloody hard work. The last thing we need is a silly myth that convinces us that we can’t write when we choose to, or that the little writing we did manage is terrible. Writer’s block is a myth. For writers young and old, it is a dangerous myth because it stops us from doing the thing that gives us the most joy in life. 

Go forth and burn writer’s block down with your words, you beautiful person. 

Enough from me: How do you handle long periods of not writing? What are your coping mechanisms? Let me know what you think in the comments. 

Till next time. 

This is Theena. 

Happy writing.
